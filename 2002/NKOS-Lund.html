<h1>NKOS Special Meeting at the NetLab conference, April 12, 2002</h1>


<i>Friday 12th of April, 14.30-17.30 </i><p>
<i>            NKOS Special Meeting: Discussion
            of standard developments regarding
            the use of thesauri, classification and
            other KO systems on the net </i>
 </p><p>

</p><h4>Participation, Goal</h4>
This is intended to be a discussion meeting between a few experts and
experienced colleagues in this field of work. There will probably be
short statements but no formal presentations. <p>
All interested participants at the NetLab conference are invited to
join this meeting, however, provided they accept this formula of the
meeting and under the condition that there is enough space in the
meeting room.
</p><p>

The goal of the meeting is to start a discussion between people 
involved in work with different encoding and modelling approaches for tesauri 
and classification systems and similar.<br>
 
We intend to make sure that we make 
an effort to prevent a situation where the concepts and understandings of what 
a tesaurus or classification system is and how it should be used do differ 
widely.
 </p><p>

</p><h4>Topics and references</h4>

Hopefully the speakers from the knowledge organization/semantic web session 
can do informal presentations at this special meeting as well (cf. the presentations linked to the <a href="netlab-programme.html">conference programme page</a>), more specific 
to the encoding and standardization approaches, problems, examples:<br>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Busch about the XML DTD approach and the  <strong>Voc-ML project</strong> (XML Schema. <a href="content/VOCML-1.pdf">Strawman DTD</a>)
</li><li>Phil Cross about <strong>RDF Schema</strong> approaches (<a href="content/NKOS%20Networked%20Knowledge%20Organization%20Systems%20and%20Services.html">RDF Schema for Thesauri</a>)
</li><li>Diane Vizine-Goetz about the OCLC plans for a <strong>taxonomy service</strong> and encoding issues related to that
 <p>
</p></li><li>Possibly Sebastian Hammer (Indexdata) can contribute with his experiences 
from the <strong>ZThes</strong> (<a href="content/zthes-04.html">Zthes: a Z39.50 Profile for Thesaurus Navigation </a> Version 0.4) effort and implementations.
 <p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>

Linda Hill pointed me to the <strong>ADL Thesaurus Protocol</strong>  work carried out in the 
Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype (ADEPT) project (<a href="content/specification.html">specification.html</a>)  which represents yet another approach.

</p>

<p>     
Another issue should be to discuss, if and how we could participate in the work of the <strong>EU Network of Excellence OntoWeb</strong> and their upcoming activities.
</p>

<p>
In addition we should have a similar discussion related to the <strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">W3C Semantic 
Web activities</a></strong>  and their <strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt/">Web Ontology Working Group</a></strong>.<br>
 Please consult the 
"Requirements for a <strong>Web Ontology Language</strong>" document at: 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/">www.w3.org/TR/webont-req/</a>
(Maybe Dan Brickley could make contributions here).
</p><p>
               
We might discuss if and how to continue to raise these NKOS issues at conferences like the <strong>Sixth European Conference on Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries </strong>, ECDL 2002, Sept 16-18, 2002, Rome, Italy and others.
</p><p>

Please feel free to invite other interested people to this meeting and to 
share thoughts and references with the rest of us.
