<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
This document presents a specification for an XML/RDF representation of
thesauri. We expect this work to evolve through feedback from other
implementors. Our deployment experience to date suggests that the current
proposal is both practical and useful; however there are a number of <a href="#openissues">open issues</a> remaining to be resolved. The proposal 
may change significantly as we attempt to resolve these issues;
implementors should be aware of this.
</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> 2000-01-24 the document is currently being
revised; the version online at this address may change as we re-organise
the structure and content of the proposal (<a href="mailto:danbri@rdfweb.org">danbri</a>).
</p>


<p>Comments and feedback should be directed to the publically archived <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/rdfthes-dev">rdfthes-dev mailing

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper proposes an RDF representation of various conceptual
relationships typical of controlled vocabularies such as thesauri,
classification systems and organised metadata collections. The aim
is to explore the use of RDF as a common formalism for representing
a variety of different thesauri and classification systems within
the same overall framework. By doing so, we expect to leverage
generic RDF facilities (such as query and storage software
components), and also to have a basis for mapping between subject
classifications expressed using these various vocabularies.</p>

<p>The approach taken here is to divide the problem into two
stages. Firstly we define a simple core RDF representation of
concepts such as 'broader term' and 'narrower term' typically used
in classification and thesauri systems. Then we extend this with a
range of more semantically meaningful relationships expressed in
terms of classes of objects. Many vocabulary systems have a tacit
or unarticulated semantic model obscured behind relatively
uninformative relationships such as 'broader' and 'narrower'. It is
usually impossible to mechanically derive a richer set of
relationships from a system based around these vague, generic
relation types. General hierarchical relationships are frequently
used to indicate one of several actual relationships. The
relationships 'is a', 'has instantiation', and 'has part', for
example, might all be encoded using the less informative 'narrower'
relation.</p>

<p>The simpler 'core' relations are best thought of as being
relationships between named concepts or terms, rather than as
relations between real world (or abstract) entities. In other
words, while we might say that "Fido is a dog" using a rich,
semantic relationship, we would say that "the-term-Fido
<i>has-broader-term</i> the-term-dog". The vague 'broader term'
relation in this case subsumes the more informative 'is a'
relation. The proposal in this document separates out these two
approaches since it is crucial to remain unambiguous about when a
node ('resource') in an RDF data model represents a named concept
or term rather than some less abstract entity, i.e. the "<i>thing
in itself</i>".</p>

<p>A further reason for creating two distinct RDF representations
for these vocabulary systems is that RDF itself includes some
common core vocabulary elements which have some overlap in
functionality with the semantic modelling facilities required to
transform simple flat vocabulary systems into richer knowledge
bases. In particular, the RDF specifications define notions of
'Class', 'Property', 'subClassOf', 'type', 'domain' and 'range',
which may be applicable to the task described above. By first
addressing the need to find a simple RDF representation for the
broader/narrow/preferred relationships, i.e. those simple relations
which make sense in the context of terms/concepts rather than
semantically modelled entities, we should be able to make some
initial progress without having to solve the entire problem of
'knowledge modelling in RDF'.</p>

<p>The next section walks through the desired set of relationships,
using bold type to indicate candidates for the simple core RDF
vocabulary. The following section sketches how a
machine-processable RDF representation of the simple term-oriented
concepts of a thesaurus might look, and finally, we give a
machine-readable RDF Schema for the simple vocabulary.</p>

<p>In the definitions given below, the term <i>Category</i> is used
when the relationship applies to classification systems,
<i>Term</i> when the relationship applies to thesauri, and
<i>Document</i> when the relationship can be used with individual
documents.</p>

<h2>3. RDF core vocabulary</h2>

<p>The relationships in bold above are candidates for a simple core
set of relationships for a thesaurus. They are:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
BroaderTerm</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--> <!--[endif]-->NarrowerTerm</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--> <!--[endif]-->Use</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--> <!--[endif]-->UsedFor</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--> <!--[endif]-->RelatedTerm</p>

<p>This terminology is taken from ISO 2788: Guidelines for the
establishment and development of monolingual thesauri
(International Organization for Standardisation, 1986).</p>

<p>The terminology deals with the terms themselves, that is, the
lexical representation of concepts. For the creation of an RDF
schema for storing structured vocabularies, we decided to
differentiate between the lexical representation of a concept and
the concept itself. It was felt that the unique resource should be
the <i>concept</i>, each concept resource being <i>indicated</i> by
one or more <i>term</i> resources. Thus the RDF resource used to
represent cats, would be <i>indicated</i> by a term whose value was
the word "cats". This is represented by the graph in figure 3
below.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><img alt="diagrammatic representation of schema" id="_x0000_i1025" src="NKOS%20Networked%20Knowledge%20Organization%20Systems%20and%20Services_files/Image7.gif" height="118" width="489"></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><i>Figure 3. RDF graph
representation of the concept representing a cat (concept
5)</i></p>

<p>In figure 3, concept_5 represents the concept of <i>cats</i>.
Its <i>indicator</i> is a term (term_7) whose value is the text
string "cats". Another term indicating the concept might have the
value "chats".</p>

<p>As a result of the above approach, the RDF schema refers to
relationships between concepts rather than between terms, and this
is reflected in the vocabulary used below, e.g. broaderConcept
rather than broaderTerm.</p>

<p>Whilst the relationships: 'broader', 'narrower', and 'related'
are still meaningful when considering concepts rather than terms,
the relationships 'use' and 'used for' refer only to terms. This is
because 'use' and 'used for' indicate which particular term has
been chosen to be used to represent the relevant concept when
indexing some resource. For the core RDF vocabulary then, these
relationships have instead been represented by properties of the
term resources. This is referred to using the attribute
'termUsage', which has values of 'preferred' or 'nonPreferred'. The
second issue considered was that since broaderTerm and narrowerTerm
are commutative, i.e.</p>

<p>A narrowerTerm B implies</p>

<p>B broaderTerm A,</p>

<p>utilising both relationships when storing or transferring the
vocabulary data would be inefficient. We therefore decided to
create a relationship 'broaderConcept' for the RDF Schema but not
'narrowerConcept', as this is implied; it being the responsibility
of any application using the data to deduce the opposite
relationship and present it to the user.</p>

<p>The second relationship between concepts chosen for the schema
was 'relatedConcept'. This term is bi-directional, and hence if the
relationship</p>

<p>A relatedConcept B exists, then it is implied that</p>

<p>B relatedConcept A is also true.</p>

<p>Hence we only add one of the two possible pairs to the
datastore.</p>

<p>A further attribute often used within thesauri, is 'top term'.
This indicates a term that is at the top of a hierarchy within the
thesaurus. Since this is a property that may be deduced by an
application from the lack of a broaderConcept property for that
concept, this attribute is also left out of the schema.</p>

<p><b>broaderConcept and relatedConcept</b> were therefore selected
as the only two core relationships between concepts that would be
required for a basic RDF vocabulary schema. Other properties are
required however to allow the encoding of thesauri, taking into
account the recommendations of ISO 2788 (International Organization
for Standardisation , 1986) and general thesaurus usage. These are
listed in the next section which describes the RDF thesaurus schema
proposed.</p>

<h2>4. RDF Thesaurus Schema</h2>

<h3>4.1. Resource Description Framework Schemas</h3>

<p>The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> (World Wide Web Consortium, 2000)
recommendation for representing structured data on the Web. RDF,
like both the Web and thesaurus systems, is based around a strategy
of managing information as a collection of links between uniquely
named entities. RDF's Web-based information model uses the term
'resource' to refer to the entities that it models, and provides an
application-neutral framework within which various kinds of
entities and relationships can be described. A general introduction
to RDF is beyond the scope of this document. The W3C home page for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> (Swick, 2000) lists a
number of introductory tutorials as well as the RDF
specifications.</p>

<p>In this document we describe the application of RDF to the
description of thesaurus-like data structures. Specifically, we
show how the RDF data model can represent a Web of inter-related
concepts and terms from one or more thesauri. To do this, we define
a simple RDF vocabulary that uses Web identifiers (Universal
Resource Identifiers) to name some relationships and resource types
useful for the description of concepts and terms in a thesaurus. It
should be noted that we do not here attempt to model the richer
semantic relationships that hold between the entities
<i>denoted</i> by such concepts, although RDF itself can also be
used to represent this kind of information.</p>

<h3>4.2. Proposal for an RDF Thesaurus Schema</h3>

<p>The XML/RDF thesaurus schema is set out in Appendix A. An
example set of XML/RDF thesaurus data is given in Appendix B.</p>

<p>As described above, the schema consists of two main resources:
Concept and Term. Concept resources are related by the properties:
'broaderConcept' and 'relatedConcept'. Concepts have a property
'indicator' which points to one or more term resources. The value
of each Term resource will be the actual text string.</p>

<p>As noted above, the Term resources have an optional property
called 'termUsage', which can be used with those thesauri that have
non-preferred terms linked to preferred terms through the use/'used
for' relationships. The value of termUsage must be either the
string 'preferred' or 'nonPreferred'.</p>

<p>A second Term property is 'lang', which can be used to indicate
the language of the term; thus a single concept can be 'indicated'
by both preferred and non-preferred terms, and by terms from
different languages (there is likely to be one preferred term for
each language). The thesaurus schema therefore provides a mechanism
for storing multilingual thesauri. If an English term and a German
term both 'indicate' the same concept resource, it is implied that
the two terms are either equivalent, or at least are treated as
such for indexing purposes.</p>

<p>It may be considered necessary to recognise relationships
between terms of different languages other than 'exactly
equivalent', such as recognising that the <i>equivalent</i> term is
broader in meaning, or where a single term in one language can be
represented by two or more terms in another. In such a case,
separate sets of concepts could be used for the different
languages, with a new set of properties devised to indicate the
different types of relationship between them, rather than using the
'lang' property.</p>

<p>There are two further optional properties that are permissible
for Concept resources: 'scope' and 'conceptCode'.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--> <!--[endif]-->The value of the scope
property is a resource called 'ScopeNote', which also has a 'lang'
property, and whose value is an optional scope note for the term. A
scope note is defined in ISO 2788 as "a note attached to a term to
indicate its meaning within an indexing language" (International
Organization for Standardisation, 1986).</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36pt; text-indent: -18pt;">
<!--[if !supportLists]--> <!--[endif]-->The property 'conceptCode'
can be used for any code that is assigned to the preferred terms in
a systematic thesaurus. In ISO 2788, the property 'address code' is
defined as a code which links terms in an alphabetical index to
their location in the systematic section. They "should have obvious
filing values &#8230; may consist simply of running numbers
&#8230; or may comprise a system of hierarchically expressive
notation" (International Organization for Standardisation, 1986).
Such a code will be unique for each concept in an RDF version of
the thesaurus and might perhaps be useful in providing a language
neutral method for indexing documents. In other thesauri, there may
be non-unique codes, such as notations that associate the terms to
broad subject categories, and such codes could also be held as
values of the conceptCode attribute. Any unique code associated
with the preferred terms in a thesaurus could also be usefully
incorporated into the URI of the Concept resources, as this would
be an aid in future management of the data (for instance for
updates to the database). However, the conceptCode property has
also been provided as a means of storing such information if
required.</p>

<h3>Appendix B: Open Issues</h3>

<p>
The following issues require further attention. Future versions of this
document might attempt this (but then again, they might not...)
</p>

<dl>

<dt>(1) URIs for 'nodes' in the thesaurus graph.
</dt>

<dd>
Should we remain agnostic about whether the nodes (resources) are assigned
public, well known URI identifiers, or should we explicitly articulate
alternative idenfification strategies for use with (so-called) anonymous
resources?
</dd>

<dt>(2) XML Schemata</dt>

<dd>We should write some XML schemas to support various message formats 
using our proposed thesaurus information model. For applications that
prefer predictable, high constrained data structures to open-ended,
extensible ones, this would be particularly useful. We could use W3C XML
Schema and/or something like Schematron, which might be more useful for
mixed-namespace specifications, eg. RSS newsfeed taxonomy data.

<dt>(3) Implementation overview</dt>

<dd>An appendix describing the ILRT implementation would be useful,
particularly if we showed use of the thesaurus data via RDF query and RDF
graph API interfaces.

<dt>(4) Analysis: thesaurus vs class hierarchy</dt>

<dd> 
Any modeling environment that has the notion of a class/type hierarchy
presents a challenge for thesaurus apps: when to use the 'built in'
hierarchy versus when to layer on top using application-specific machinery
('broader-term' versus 'rdfs:subClassOf'). More guidance for implementors
is needed on this topic. Use WordNet to illustrate this.
