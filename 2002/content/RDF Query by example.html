<h4><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h4>

<p>This paper is for the 'Netlab and friends' <a href="#%5BNETLAB%5D">[NETLAB]</a> conference in the section on
interoperability. 'NetLab and friends' is a celebration of ten
years of Netlab, and of Netlab's contribution to technology on the
web and in particular to the development of Digital Libraries. This
paper is about RDF query, and specifically how simple RDF query
languages can help members of the Digital Libraries community use
RDF data right now.</p>

<p>RDF is structured data. Instead of putting information in a Word
document or a simple html file, or in 'vanilla' XML, you store your
information in XML documents using a particular set of conventions
for writing that XML, or in such a way that you can export the data
to XML documents using those conventions (for example in a database
or a spreadsheet, or even in certain forms of xhtml).</p>

<p>The important thing about RDF is the information model, which is
a directed label graph, that is, objects in the world are
represented by nodes, and their properties by arcs that link the
nodes together. Here is an example of the <a href="http://ilrt.org/discovery/2002/04/query/netlab-paper.rdf">RDF for this paper</a>, expressed as a
graph:</p>

<img src="RDF%20Query%20by%20example_files/netlab0.jpe"> 

<p>Using the RDF set of conventions for exporting structured data
has as its goal data-interoperability. RDF's node-arc-node model
provides a minimal structure for interoperability, because it
encodes directly information which is often implicit in other
formats, such as 'vanilla' XML documents or IAFA templates.
</p>

<p>The first hurdle with RDF is the question: <em>why</em> would
you want to use RDF as your structured data format for your
particular project? After all, there are a number of widely used,
well tested and mature protocols and query and data formats in use
in the Digital Library community already.</p>

<p>The answer is that if you have control and will always have
control over your data you don't need RDF. You can use any data
format and protocol you like: XML format of your own choice, a
particular profile of Z3950 or Whois++, for example. This applies
whether the data is private to your organisation (such as internal
company records or databases), or whether you can control the data
that is provided for you (for example as with the normalisation of
data for the Renardus project). There is no one best way of storing
and retrieving structured data.</p>

<p>However, in many cases you will not control the data you are
working with. Distributed data is difficult to control, because you
have to rely on others to provide it. Data is also difficult to
control over time, as requirements for the data change over time.
Another example is data from unexpected sources, which might be
reuseable, but probably isn't in your preferred format.</p>

<p>If you do not control the data you have to deal with, because
you don't own it, or because it may change over time, or because
you don't know what you might want to combine it with next, then
using RDF and associated modeling strategies and tools ('Semantic
Web technologies') is useful now. Part of the reason for this is
that the RDF model uses certain principles for modelling data which
help with interoperability. Three of these are discussed in the
next section, section 1. Section 2 briefly describes a simple RDF
query language. In Section 3 we describe two different
possibilities for combining data from different sources using RDF
and RDF query.</p>

<h4><a name="one">1.</a> Three principles for creating interoperable
data</h4>

<p>RDF is defined by its model, not its syntax. Using the RDF model
for your data from the start can help save time if you ever want to
combine the data with any other data, whether you decide to use the
RDF syntax and an RDF database and query language or whether you
use a relational database or Z39.50 to store and serve up the data.
There are three basic modeling principles that are used to create
RDF data:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the RDF information model: nodes and arcs</li>

<li>Use universal resource identifiers: URLs, mailtos</li>

<li>Define the structure of information: write schemas</li>
</ol>

<h3>Principle 1: Use the RDF information model (nodes and
arcs)</h3>

<p>The RDF model is a good sanity check for interoperable data. RDF
uses nodes and connecting arcs to talk about objects and their
properties, so that you start thinking in terms of objects and
their properties rather than in terms of documents and their
syntax. This improves extensibility and may help modelling
style.</p>

<p>For example suppose you have a ROADS SERVICE file format, which
has the field 'Record-Created-Email'. An addition to the template
requires a (small) change to the parser, so that the format is not
very easily extensible. Moreover, the underyling model is implicit
in the format. 'Record-Created-Email' is a shortcut from the record
to the person that created the record, to the email address of that
person. This is just a different modeling style, but it also
obscures some of the structure of the record that might help
interoperability. 'Persons' often crop up in different sorts of
records, but here the fact that a person created the record isn't
clear. This is also a common problem with 'vanilla' XML: the
emphasis is on the syntax of the document not the underlying model.
There is nothing wrong per se with this type of modelling, but it
can limit extensibility and interoperability.</p>

<p>The RDF/XML syntax has been much criticised, but it is highly
expressive and extensible, and there are now many tools that
process it <a href="#%5BJENA%5D">[JENA]</a>, <a href="#%5BSIRPAC%5D">[SIRPAC]</a>. There are also some tools which
allow you to create arbitrary RDF using a visual editor <a href="#%5BRDFAuthor%5D">[RDFAUTHOR]</a>, <a href="#%5BISAVIZ%5D">[ISAVIZ]</a>. You do not have to use RDF/XML
syntax as the primary store of your data, but as an interchange
format, it is very useful.</p>

<h3>Principle 2: Use URIs as identifiers where possible</h3>

<p>Or rather, use <em>well-known, public</em> URIs where possible:
don't make them up if you can avoid it. In RDF nodes are either
'blank nodes' or are identified using URIs. RDF processors
automatically assume that objects with the same URI are the same
object.</p>

<p>In the case of people and certain documents it is not good
modelling style to conflate the URI with the thing. A person is not
their email address, and a document might have several URLs. In
this case it is useful to use indirection. If the document does not
have a single URL, then it can still have a dc:identifier pointing
to a URL. A person can have a foaf:mbox pointing to their email
address. RDF processors will not merge nodes identified indirectly,
although schema annotations can be used to do this <a href="#%5BSMUSH%5D">[SMUSH]</a>. Sometimes it may seem simpler to
forgo modeling accuracy for simplicity, but be careful - things can
go wrong because RDF will assume that things with the same uri are
the same object. For example, characteristics of a document might
get confused with the characteristics of a particular instance of the 
document retrievable by from a url, if you name the document with the url
of a retrievable instance of it.
</p>

<p>For interoperability purposes, it is most helpful to use
well-known, public identifiers, otherwise you'll have to keep
stating that 'urn:ilrtperson2356' and 'urn:rdfwebperson347687' are
the same individual, and processing information form different
sources will be slow and cumbersome.</p>

<h3>Principle 3: Write schemas</h3>

<p>RDF Schemas describe the broad structure of types of RDF
documents, such as what types of arcs can link what types of nodes.
They can also include information about class heirarchies: you can
build elaborate links describing subclasses of objects. </p>

<p>So for example you could use <a href="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Dublin Core</a> to
represent information about webpages and other documents; the
experimental <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">foaf</a>
vocabulary or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vcard-rdf">vCard in
RDF</a> for people, addresses, relationships. Reusing vocabularies
can be difficult if parts of a schema are similar to what you want,
but do not quite represent it exactly. RDF has <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subclassof">subClassOf</a>
and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_subpropertyof">subPropertyOf</a>
relationships to accommodate these similarities interoperably.
These are not currently processed in very many tools but are useful
for fixing the meaning of classes and properties precisely, and
will likely be used in the future.</p>

<p>RDF does not require schemas: you can do a great deal without
using them at all. However for interoperability it is helpful to
describe what you meant your RDF to represent in machine-readable
and human-readable form. This enables people to reinterpret your
data more accurately.</p>


<h3>Storing RDF</h3>

<p>Once you have used these methods in your modeling, you have
various options for actually storing your data. One option is to
use RDF/XML documents as the primary store of your data and then
use an RDF processor and a pure RDF database (one designed to store
RDF). However, you do not have to use a 'pure' RDF database for
storing the information, and in fact there are significant
overheads to doing so, in particular the immaturity of the
technology and the specialist knowledge that will probably be
required. Another option is to store your data in (say) a
relational database and export it to RDF/XML files. 
</p>

<p>Having said that, RDF databases are extremely flexible, and if
your data structure changes rapidly you may find them very useful.
For similar reasons, an RDF database can provide an interim
solution for experimenting with combining different types of data
until you settle on a good optimised structure in a well-understood
database. The rest of this paper provides some examples of using
mixed data with an RDF database that understands an RDF query
language.</p>

<h3><a name="two">2.</a> RDF Query: asking questions of very flexible
data</h3>

<p>If you do choose an RDF database, you need a way of accessing
information that mirrors the flexibility of the RDF information
model. RDF query languages such as SquishQL <a href="#%5BINKLING%5D">[INKLING]</a> (which I've been working on) all
query the RDF information model directly, and do not care about how
the information is stored.</p>

<p>For example, the query below says:</p>

<p>"find me the name of the person whose email address is
libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk, and also find me the title and
identifier of anything that she has created"</p>

<pre>select ?name, ?title, ?identifier 
where 
(dc::title ?paper ?title)
(dc::creator ?paper ?creator)
(dc::identifier ?paper ?uri)
(foaf::name ?creator ?name) 
(foaf::mbox ?creator mailto:libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk) 
using dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
</pre>

<p>Simple RDF queries such as this one just try and match parts of
the RDF model in the database. Because of this, you can describe
the query itself as a graph, as below:</p>

<img src="RDF%20Query%20by%20example_files/netlab1.jpe"> 

<p>The query describes the pattern of the information we want to
match, not the way it is stored in the database. If we find some
more data about reviews of papers, we can add this to our database
and query it without redesigning the database structure, and by
rewriting our query slightly:</p>

<pre>select ?name, ?title, ?identifier, ?content  
where 
(dc::title ?paper ?title)
(dc::creator ?paper ?creator)
(dc::identifier ?paper ?uri)
(foaf::name ?creator ?name) 
(foaf::mbox ?creator mailto:libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk) 
(foaf::review ?paper ?review)
(foaf::content ?review ?content)
using dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
</pre>

<img src="RDF%20Query%20by%20example_files/netlab2.jpe"> 

<p>This differs from the relational model where you have to know
the structure of tables before you can make the query. The
relational model ties the data strongly to the way it is stored,
which means that changes to the structure of the data require
changes to the structure of the database, as well as changes to the
query.</p>

<p>In contrast when new information is added to a pure RDF
database, the structure of the database does not change in a
relational sense. RDF data is semi-structured and does not rely on
the presence of a schema for storage or query. This makes pure RDF
databases very useful for prototyping and for other fast-moving
data environments.</p>

<h3><a name="three">3.</a> Lightweight, hackable interoperability with RDF
query: two
examples</h3>

<p>RDF gets you thinking in terms of combining information, and how
to make it (relatively) easy. You might start thinking...</p>

<ul>
<li>what sorts of information do we have lying around that would
increase the usefulness of our core information set?</li>

<li>how difficult would it be to combine these sets of
information?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example 1: Publications, ROADS editors recommendations and
bookmarks</h4>

<ul>
<li>At the University of Bristol, we are supposed to enter our
publications information into a central database, so that funding
calculations can be made.</li>

<li>ROADS editing templates <a href="#%5BROADS%5D">[ROADS]</a> contain
information about who created the record. ROADS templates are used
in SOSIG <a href="#%5BSOSIG%5D">[SOSIG]</a>, based at the University of
Bristol in the ILRT. The creator information is currently kept
private although there are links <a href="#%5BEDITORS%5D">[EDITORS]</a>
on the SOSIG site to subject editors names and descriptions of
them, although not on a per-record basis.</li>

<li>Cataloguers often have a bookmarks file, or part of one,
containing a list of their favourite places to look for new
information on the web and also possible future sites to
catalogue.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, let's find out more about the editors at SOSIG. You can
already get to a brief description of the editor of a section: why
not combine this information with papers they have authored, and
with their current SOSIG-related bookmarks list? Technically this
is fairly simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>ROADS templates contain the email addresses of their authors,
if correctly completed, so that we can trace who created the
record. ROADS records are faily simple to express as RDF, at least
in summary format.</li>

<li>The Perl Bookmark module can be used to parse bookmarks files,
and the format is fairly simple to write as RDF, since it basically
consists of a list of links.</li>

<li>The publications data at the University of Bristol is available
in an SQL database dump format to departments in the
university.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using Dublin Core and a simple bookmarks schema all these
formats can be converted to RDF/XML files. They can then be
harvested into an RDF database and queried (see below for various
options for storing and querying RDf data). An example query might
look something like this:</p>

<p>"find me all the bookmarks from the bookmarks file of the person
with email address 'emma.place@bristol.ac.uk' which are dated more
recently than 1st April 2002".</p>

<pre>select ?bookmark, ?title, ?date   
where 
(foaf::mbox ?person mailto:emma.place@bristol.ac.uk) 
(bm::bookmarkFile ?person ?file) 
(bm::bookmark ?file ?bookmark) 
(dc::title ?bookmark ?title) 
(dc::date ?bookmark ?date) 
and ?date &gt; 2002-04-01
using dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
bm for http://example.com/bookmarks/
</pre>

<img src="RDF%20Query%20by%20example_files/netlab3.jpe"> 

<p>The results of such a query might look something like this:</p>

<table bgcolor="#dddddd">
<tbody><tr>
<td>bookmark</td>
<td>title</td>
<td>date</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://www.psychology.ltsn.ac.uk/</td>
<td>LTSN Psychology</td>
<td>2002-04-02</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://www.bids.ac.uk/</td>
<td>BIDS</td>
<td>2002-04-04</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The social constraints on using these pieces of information
together might be more limiting than the technical aspects.
Although many people make their bookmarks available publically on
the web, some would not dream of doing so. People might object to
such a swathe of information being made available about them.</p>

<b>What benefit might something like this give SOSIG?</b> 

<p>It gets people thinking about different kinds of information
that might improve the service. Let's say that the editors aren't
happy with everyone being able to see their bookmarks, but would be
happy for other editors to see them. Then they could see what other
subject editors were working on, check for duplicates, and get
useful ideas for where to go next. Or suppose they're not happy for
people to see their bookmarks, but would find a blogging tool
helpful in the cataloging process, the output of which they would
be happy to share.</p>

<p>The user of the service now has an interesting way of checking
the credentials of the subject editors. The service does not just
say: "trust us because we are trustworthy, non-profit making and
have a long history of providing good resources", but "trust us
because of the credentials of the named individuals who find and
catalogue resources for us."</p>

<p>Finally, combining this information together might make
technical people think about how they might generalise this
cataloging model to a more inclusive annotating model, and how this
might be managed, for example:</p>

<p>"select annotations by people that Emma knows of
professionally"</p>

<pre>select ?annotation, ?content 
where 
(ann::annotates ?annotation ?file) 
(ann::content ?annotation ?content) 
(dc::creator ?annotation ?knownPerson) 
(foaf::mbox ?person mailto:emma.place@bristol.ac.uk) 
(foaf::knowsOfProfessionally ?person ?knownPerson) 
using dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
ann for http://example.com/annotations/

<h5>Example 2: A very simple portal</h5>

<p>For interoperability between organisations, simple is often
better, especially if there are many organisations involved.</p>

<p>RSS <a href="#%5BRSS%5D">[RSS]</a> is a well-known syndication
format expressed in RDF/XML, originally designed to syndicate news
stories. It's very simple indeed, consisting essentially of a list
of links with titles and descriptions, and a container to hold
them. As of RSS 1.0, simple RSS files can be extended with modules
for a particular purpose, for example with a set of Dublin Core
elements to describe webpages in more detail.</p>

<p>At LTSN Economics <a href="#%5BLTSN-ECON%5D">[LTSN-ECON]</a>, Martin
Poulter has been experimenting with the RSS 1.0 events module <a href="#%5BRSS-EVENTS%5D">[RSS-EVENTS]</a> to describe conference
information <a href="#%5BLTSN-EVENTS%5D">[LTSN-EVENTS]</a>. The events
module adds a start date and an end date to the standard RSS item,
and a location, and an organiser. Other LTSN centres have also been
producing ordinary RSS 1.0 feeds <a href="#%5BLTSN-FEEDS%5D">[LTSN-FEEDS]</a>, as have various
organisations in the subject gateway community, spurred on by
Ukoln's RSSXpress <a href="#%5BRSSXPRESS%5D">[RSSXPRESS]</a>.</p>

<p>SOSIG's Grapevine service <a href="#%5BGRAPE%5D">[GRAPE]</a> has a
personalization feature that can display feeds described as RSS
1.0. But we can do even more interesting things using query. Let's
suppose we have a list of feeds such as that at UKoln's RSSExpress
page. Then we produce a piece of RDF describing those feeds, for
example by classifying them according to their subject within the
SOSIG classification system. Then we can load all the feeds into an
RDF database, load in our little RDF description file about the
feeds, and with just a couple of queries we have a 'portal'.</p>

<p>First we ask: what feed would you like?</p>

<pre>select ?feedUrl, ?title  
where 
(dc::subject ?feedUrl ?subject)
(rss::title ?feedUrl ?title)
and ?subject ~ "economics"
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
</pre>

<p>results</p>

<table bgcolor="#dddddd">
<tbody><tr>
<td>feedUrl</td>
<td>title</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://chewbacca.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/events/events.xml</td>
<td>LTSN Economics events</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://www.cepr.org/aboutcepr/cepr.rss</td>
<td>Centre for Economic Policy Research</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://www.bized.ac.uk/homeinfo/whatsnew.htm</td>
<td>Biz/ed What's New</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>then we create each feed using another query which asks for the
items, their urls and titles:</p>

<pre>select ?item, ?ti, ?li 
where 
(rss::items http://chewbacca.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/events/events.xml ?seq)
(?contains ?seq ?item)
(rss::title ?item ?ti) 
(rss::link ?item ?li) 
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
</pre>

<p>And with a little html formatting, we have a portal!</p>

<p>If we have a channel picker like that on SOSIG Grapevine, we
could store people's selections of feeds as an RDF file, and then
pull them out again next time using a query like this one:</p>

<pre>select ?feedUrl, ?title  
where 
(sosig::profile ?person ?profile)
(sosig::channel ?profile ?feedUrl)
(rss::title ?feedUrl ?title)
(foaf::mbox ?person mailto:libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk)
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/
sosig for http://www.sosig.ac.uk/schemas/profiles/
</pre>

<p>Something as simple as a Perl regex can be used to parse RSS
files with great effect. The advantage of using RDF query to do it
is that it makes the query and display of RSS extensions or modules
very simple. For example, a query of the basic RSS form of the LTSN
event feed looks just like the query for any other feed:</p>

<pre>select ?item, ?title, ?link  
where 
(rss::items http://chewbacca.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/events/events.xml ?seq)
(?anyPredicate ?seq ?item)
(rss::title ?item ?title) 
(rss::link ?item ?link) 
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
</pre>

<p>adding the events information makes the query look like
this:</p>

<pre>select ?title, ?link, ?start, ?end, ?location  
where 
(rss::items http://chewbacca.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/events/events.xml ?seq)
(?anyPredicate ?seq ?item)
(rss::title ?item ?title) 
(rss::link ?item ?link) 
(ev::startdate ?item ?start) 
(ev::enddate ?item ?end) 
(ev::location ?item ?location) 
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
ev for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/
</pre>

<p>giving us results that look like this:</p>

<table bgcolor="#dddddd">
<tbody><tr>
<td>link</td>
<td>title</td>
<td>start</td>
<td>end</td>
<td>location</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://crm.hct.ac.ae/tend2002/</td>
<td>Bridging the Divide - Strategies for Change</td>
<td>2002-04-07</td>
<td>2002-04-09</td>
<td>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>http://www.scoteconsoc.org/ses2002.html</td>
<td>SEA Annual Conference</td>
<td>2002-04-11</td>
<td>2002-04-12</td>
<td>Dundee, UK</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We could even start limiting the scope of our searches and
combining various feeds, for example:</p>

<p>"find me all the events starting in April 2002 from all feeds
which can be picked out using the search term economics"</p>

<pre>select ?item, ?title, ?link, ?start, ?end, ?location  
where 
(dc::subject ?feedUrl ?subject)
(rss::items ?feedurl ?seq)
(?anyPredicate ?seq ?item)
(rss::title ?item ?title) 
(rss::link ?item ?link) 
(ev::startdate ?item ?start) 
(ev::enddate ?item ?end) 
(ev::location ?item ?location) 
and ?subject ~ "economics"
and ?start ~ "2002-04" 
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
ev for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/
dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
</pre>

<p>Simple RDF queries like the SquishQL examples here are not
particularly powerful: they can't do 'OR' queries for example. But
they can make queries of flexible data in a fairly easy to
understand fashion.</p>

<h4><a name="four">4.</a> Completer-finisher stage: Getting from hack to
service</h4>

<p>You may want to optimise your database for certain queries, once
you have experimented with combining RDF data. One way of doing
this is to collect RDF information in one RDF database, and then
use RDF query to pick out the parts you want to optimise for.</p>

<p>For example, suppose we had a number of interesting economics
RSS events feeds available. A query such as</p>

<pre>select ?item, ?title, ?link, ?start, ?end, ?location  
where 
(dc::subject ?feedUrl ?subject)
(rss::items ?feedurl ?seq)
(?anyPredicate ?seq ?item)
(rss::title ?item ?title) 
(rss::link ?item ?link) 
(ev::startdate ?item ?start) 
(ev::enddate ?item ?end) 
(ev::location ?item ?location) 
and ?subject ~ "economics"
and ?start ~ "2002-04" 
using rss for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/
ev for http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/event/
dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
</pre>

<p>(repeated from above) gives us the raw ingredients of a simple
flat relational database structure, with one table:</p>

<table bgcolor="#dddddd">
<tbody><tr>
<td>id</td>
<td>link</td>
<td>title</td>
<td>start</td>
<td>end</td>
<td>location</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>which we can then query using SQL to create a nice html list of
conferences for our economics users (or perhaps our own RSS feed).
In this way, RDF databases and query can be an intermediate step,
helping us to gather and organise diverse data before
optimising.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>My aim has been to show how RDF tools can be useful to the
Digital libraries community now. I've suggested that while RDF
tools may not be as fast and well-understood as more conventional
databases and protocols, nevertheless they can be used to combine
information from multiple sources in interesting and practical ways
that can extend the functionality of services.</p>

<p>Tools you might like to try include Jena <a href="#%5BJENA%5D">[JENA]</a>, SquishQL/Inkling <a href="#%5BINKLING%5D">[INKLING]</a>, SquishQL/Ruby <a href="#%5BRUBY-RDF%5D">[RUBY-RDF]</a> tools for storing and querying
RDF in SQL databases. RDFStore <a href="#%5BRDFSTORE%5D">[RDFSTORE]</a>
includes a Perl implementation; RDFdb <a href="#%5BRDFDB%5D">[RDFDB]</a> has a similar query language, on which
SquishQL was based. Redland <a href="#%5BREDLAND%5D">[REDLAND]</a> is a
fast RDF database. Many more RDF query languages and databases
systems are available - see Dave Beckett's RDF resource guide <a href="#%5BBECKETT%5D">[BECKETT]</a>.</p>
