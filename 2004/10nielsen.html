The 3rd European Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services
(NKOS) Workshop, organised by Marianne Lykke Nielsen with assistance
from co-organizers Anna Gjerluf Eslau (H. Lundbeck) and Doug Tudhope
(University of Glamorgan), took place on September 16, 2004, in Bath,
UK, as part of <a href="http://www.ecdl2004.org/" target="_blank">ECDL 2004</a>.  Forty-eight people attended the full-day workshop.
</p>

<p>
The objective of the workshop was to facilitate exchange of experiences
and ideas about topics and problems related to the user-centred design
of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), such as considerations
concerning the role of KOS, determination of conceptual content, and
methodological and technical issues, including standardisation
initiatives. The workshop programme was divided into three sessions:
Session 1 - User-centred approaches to KOS design, Session 2 -
Standardisation initiatives, and Session 3 - KOS applications and
methods.
</p>

<p>The session about user-centred approaches started with an overview
by Marianne Lykke Nielsen of methodological approaches to user-centred
KOS design. Next Tamara Sumner and Faisal Ahmad reported on the
experiences, architecture and protocol of the NSDL Strand Map Service,
a learning tool and knowledge organisation system based on learning
goals articulated in the <i>US Benchmarks and Atlas of Science Literacy</i>.
Also presented was the user-centred design process in which users have
been involved throughout the design process by needs analysis and
usability tests. Caterina Caracciolo presented a domain-specific
ontology, particularly how the display and functionality had been
developed according to findings from a user study. Dorothee Blocks
discussed a model of information searching behaviour, based on findings
from two in-depth user behaviour studies. The model reflects
interactions between end-users and the KOS and may facilitate and
support user-centred design of KOS by providing information on
end-users' searching behaviour. The last speaker in Session 1 was
Mathew Weaver, who presented the knowledge structures for a
domain-specific digital library for USDA Forest Service resource
managers. He discussed the domain- and user-centred design process and
the specific conceptual and semantic problems that the design should
meet to support end-users' information retrieval. The presentation of
Hella Møller Rasmussen was omitted, as the presenter was unable to
attend the workshop. However, Rasmussen's presentation is available at
the workshop website. </p>

<p>
Doug Tudhope introduced the session on standardization initiatives.
Stella Dextre Clarke reported on the ongoing work of the UK BSI
Thesaurus Standards Group on revisions to the existing standard.
Alistair Miles discussed the SKOS-Core and mapping schemas resulting
from the W3C SWAD-E Thesaurus Activity, together with the SKOS (Simple
Knowledge Organization Systems) web service API. They aim to provide a
framework for using KOS such as thesauri, terminology, taxonomies,
glossaries, and classification systems in the Semantic Web. Edmund Lee
reported on the English Heritage project currently developing a
discovery tool registering KOS resources and terminology standards
within the UK heritage sector. David Martul provided an update on topic
maps and presented a linguistic framework for topic maps, with use
cases from legal applications.
</p>

<p>In session 3 the work of Piotr Gawrysiak on how to use semantic text
analysis for vocabulary development was presented by Stefka Kaloyanova.
Martin Doerr presented a statistical method for estimating the
precision, completeness and inconsistency of place names matching with
digital gazetteers, such as the Alexandria Digital Library Gazetteer. </p>

<p>
The presentations resulted in a wide range of comments and discussion
throughout the workshop, an important goal of the workshop.
Participants identified various open issues and themes for continuing
work and collaboration:
</p>


<ul>
	<li>Need for empirical studies and usability testing of end-user interaction with KOS</li>
	<li>Problems related to visualization, including meaningful presentation of discourses and semantic perspectives</li>
	<li>Issues and problems related to vocabulary mapping, including mapping between core and special vocabularies</li>
	<li>Multi-lingual aspects</li>
	<li>Evaluation and validation of KOS</li>
	<li>Statistical development methods and techniques</li>
	<li>Types and standard definitions of relationships between concepts and terms</li>
	<li>Extension of current thesaurus standards as regards definition and inclusion of KOS types</li>
	<li>Networked access to KOS in DL and Semantic Web applications </li>
</ul>

NKOS is a community of researchers, developers and practitioners
seeking to enable KOS, as networked interactive information services
via the Internet. This was the third European NKOS Workshop. For
details of the previous European workshops as well as the seven US NKOS
Workshops, see the NKOS website at &lt;<a href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/" target="_blank">http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/</a>&gt;.

<p>
Submissions are being sought for a special issue of the <i>Journal New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia</i>
planned for 2005/6, which will build on the themes of the workshop. The
Call for Papers will shortly be posted on the journal's website (<a href="http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/13614568.asp" target="_blank">http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/13614568.asp</a>) or contact the Editor (douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk) for more information.
