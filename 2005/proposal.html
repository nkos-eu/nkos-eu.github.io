<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classifications, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri, attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for the purposes of retrieval. New networked KOS services and applications are emerging and we have the opportunity to draw on a number of technologies that can be combined to yield new solutions. These include developments of Information Science approaches to automatic indexing and vocabulary mapping, search systems and interfaces, together with contributions from other disciplines. For example, we can formalise and enrich existing representations for automated KOS applications, exploiting the infrastructure of Semantic Web encoding schemes and technologies. Language engineering offers a variety of tools and linguistic resources. New standards in web services are emerging and user centred approaches are yielding more sophisticated models of how users search for information.
</p>

<p>The workshop aims to address the following <strong>key themes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User-centred design issues</strong> - User-centred design strategies for KOS. How to develop understandable and thorough descriptions of concepts and terms? How to show and explain relationships? The challenge is to find the appropriate level of explanation, clarity and conciseness.</li>
<li><strong>Mapping between different KOS</strong> - How to achieve semantic interoperability? Cross-browsing and cross-searching between distributed KOS services. Mapping between terms, classes, systems and types of KOS. Innovative visualization methods to support KOS development and mapping.</li>
<li><strong>KOS representations and service protocols</strong> - A basic infrastructure is needed to provide protocols for networked, programmatic access to a variety of vocabularies for different end users and applications. These require standard representations in formats such as RDF/XML. What is the appropriate granularity of base services to apply in evolving Web/Grid environments?</li>
</ul>
     
<p>
The aim of the workshop is to bring together diverse communities and facilitate exchange of viewpoints and ideas, to provide an opportunity for communication and coordination between various, distinctive research programmes and projects dealing with development and design of KOS. The issues discussed may range from considerations related to the role of KOS, conceptual content and design, methodological issues, and technical issues (protocols and XML-RDF technologies).
</p>
<p><strong>Other topics for presentations can also be proposed. Possible examples include</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>NKOS registries</li>
<li>Topic Map standards and how they might relate to KOS standards</li>
<li>Ontology description languages, W3C standards</li>
<li>Semantic Web and Semantic Grid implications (web services)</li>
<li>Terminology Services (taxonomy servers) and linking to associated DL service protocols</li>
<li>Integrating language engineering/terminology/corpus analysis studies and NKOS research</li>
<li>Appropriate user interfaces for terminology services and KOS visualisation</li>
<li>Semi-automatic methods that combine automated KOS creation and enhancement with intellectual development methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Provisional workshop</h3>

<p>The full-day workshop will consist of technical presentations and demonstrations with discussion.</p>
