<p><strong>Douglas Tudhope</strong> is Reader in the School of Computing, University 
  of Glamorgan and leads the Hypermedia Research Unit. He graduated from the University 
  of Edinburgh in 1976 with a 1st class Honours BSc in Computer Science. He received 
  a PhD from the University of Wales in 1981. Before joining the University of 
  Glamorgan, he worked as a Programmer/Analyst, at the University of California, 
  San Diego for the Hubble Space Telescope Project 1984 - 1989, with responsibilities 
  in the areas of image processing and analysis and system management. His main 
  current research interests are the intersecting areas of information science, 
  digital libraries and hypermedia and in the emerging semantic web/grid. He directed 
  the UK national science research council (EPSRC) funded FACET project in collaboration 
  with the UK Science Museum; J. Paul Getty Trust (provided the Art and Architecture 
  Thesaurus for the project); Museum Documentation Association; Canadian Heritage 
  Information Network. This project investigated semantic query expansion in thesaurus-based 
  retrieval and the close integration of the thesaurus in the search interface. 
  Since 1977, he has been Editor of the journal, <em>New Review of Hypermedia

<h3><a name="abstract"></a>Extended Abstract</h3>
<p>We propose a full-day workshop of projects, research, and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (NKOS) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended NKOS workshops at ECDL 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005. We would expect 40 attendees at this workshop.</p>
<p>The proposal is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website. Previous NKOS workshops have resulted in journal special issues (see References). Authors presenting significant results at the workshop will be encouraged tosubmit papers for consideration in a future issue of the Journal of Digital Information (Koch and Tudhope are JoDI theme editors for Information Discovery).</p>
<p>Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classifications, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri, attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain. Modern digital information systems afford more options for mapping and presenting alternative orders of information than traditional physical libraries. The digital environment offers more possibilities of presenting information from different interests and discourses. Thus, the challenge is as much intellectual as technical when we want to develop knowledge organization systems that are useful and meaningful for the end-users operating in complex, interdisciplinary knowledge domains. The workshop would address the following general themes, although we will also remain open to emergent issues:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>User-centred design issues.</em></strong> User-centred design strategies for KOS. How to develop understandable and thorough descriptions of concepts and terms? How to show and explain relationships? The challenge is to find the appropriate level of explanation, clarity and conciseness. Innovative visualisations of KOS content may assist - how to achieve these in networked situations?</li>

<li><strong><em>KOS Interoperability</em></strong>. Cross-browsing and cross-searching between distributed KOS services, mapping between terms, classes and systems, mapping between KOS and ontologies. How to achieve semantic interoperability?</li>
<li><strong><em>KOS representations and service protocols.</em></strong> A basic infrastructure is needed in order to achieve programmatic access to KOS services. We need to provide protocols for networked access to a variety of vocabularies for different end users and applications. These require standard representations in formats such as RDF/XML. What is the appropriate granularity of base services to apply in evolving Web/Grid environments?</li>
<li><strong><em>Terminology services.</em></strong> We need to identify and specify terminology services for different applications, within a service-oriented approach/architecture, building on the basic infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong><em>Social tagging.</em></strong> Participative user-based approaches to knowledge organization and cataloguing are emerging and attracting significant community support. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS?</li> 
</ul>
<p><strong>Semantic Web Special Session.</strong> A significant feature of this NKOS workshop will be a special session, highlighting Semantic Web applications of KOS in Digital Libraries. This builds on Semantic Web contacts established at previous NKOS workshops at ECDL and represents a convergence of semantic Digital Library efforts from LIS and Semantic Web communities. This session will be chaired by Thomas Baker and Bernhard Haslhofer.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web effort has provided standards and technologies for expressing, exchanging and processing metadata. Initial infrastructure possibilities for tomorrow's semantic Digital Libraries are now emerging. Projects such as BRICKS, JeromeDL, SIMILE and SWAD-Europe (for example) are exploiting semantic descriptions to enhance machine-support for end users in their search for content and information and interoperability generally. Possible themes for the session include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Architecture and design issues for Semantic Digital Libraries</li>
<li>Enabling standards and technologies</li>
<li>Case studies and application scenarios</li>
<li>P2P solutions for interconnecting Semantic Digital Libraries</li>
<li>Enhanced semantic-aware search, browsing and retrieval functionalities</li>
<li>Integration of existing metadata into a Semantic Digital Library</li>

<li>Enabling ontologies, thesauri, and other controlled vocabularies</li>
</ul>

<p align="right"><small><a href="#top">Back to top</a></small></p>
<h3><a name="structure"></a>Workshop Structure</h3>
<p>An open call for papers will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and demonstrations. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process. Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours, including lunch and breaks:</p>

<p><strong>Session 1:</strong> Welcome and introduction (hrs 0:30)<br />
  <strong>Session 2:</strong> Presentations drawing on five themes outlined above 
  (hrs: 2:30)<br />

  <strong>Session 3:</strong> Special Session focusing on Semantic Web issues 
  (hrs: 2:30)<br />
  <strong>Session 4:</strong> Briefing session in which emergent issues may be 
  presented and discussed (hrs 1)<br />
  <strong>Session 5:</strong> Concluding directed discussion, including options 
  for co-operation (hrs 0.30)</p>

<p>Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website.</p>
