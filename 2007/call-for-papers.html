<h2>Call for Presentations and Participation</h2>

<p>The 6th NKOS Workshop at the European Digital Library Conference will will take place on 
September 21st, as part of ECDL 2007 in Budapest (<a 
href="http://www.ecdl2007.org/">http://www.ecdl2007.org/</a>).</p>
<p>Proposals are invited for presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion 
time, potentially longer if the substance and importance warrant it) on work or 
projects related to the themes of the workshop (<a 
href="#themes">see 
below</a>) or to NKOS more generally. The traditionally reflective style of the 
NKOS workshops allows time for discussion and features a briefing 
session for shorter communications and emergent topics.</p>
<p>Please email proposals (approx. 500 words including aims, methods, main 
findings) by June 29th to Douglas Tudhope (<a 
href="mailto:douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk">douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk</a>). Advance indication 
that you intend to submit a presentation would be helpful. Proposals will be 
peer-reviewed by the program committee and notification of acceptance will be 
given by July 17th. The early registration deadline for the conference and the 
workshop is July 31st.</p>
<p>After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the 
workshop website. Presentations from the Workshop may be invited to be submitted 
as extended paper to the electronic peer reviewed journal: Journal of Digital 
Information, JoDI (<a 
href="http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/">http://journals.tdl.org/jodi/</a>).</p>
<p>The workshop aims to address key challenges for KOS posed by the overlapping 
themes of</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social tagging </li>
	<li>Semantic Web applications and implications of KOS</li>
	<li>Terminology for language-oriented applications</li>
	<li>Terminology registry</li>
  <li>Terminology services </li>
  <li>KOS Interoperability </li>
  <li>User-centred design issues </li>
</ul>
<p>However, other NKOS topics can also be proposed. For inspiration, visit the 
NKOS network website at: <a

<h3><a name=themes></a>Themes</h3>
<p>Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classifications, gazetteers, lexical 
databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri, attempt to model the underlying 
semantic structure of a domain. Modern digital information systems afford more 
options for mapping and presenting alternative orders of information than 
traditional physical libraries. The digital environment offers more 
possibilities of presenting information from different interests and discourses. 
Thus, the challenge is as much intellectual as technical when we want to develop 
knowledge organization systems that are useful and meaningful for the end-users 
operating in complex, interdisciplinary knowledge domains. The workshop would 
address the following general themes, although we will also remain open to 
emergent issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social tagging. Participative user-based approaches to knowledge organization and cataloguing are emerging and attracting significant community support. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS?</li>
<li>Semantic Web applications and implications of KOS. How can KOS contribute to Semantic Web efforts and conversely how can Semantic Web standards and technologies facilitate novel KOS applications and semantic interoperability research. What are the next steps for SKOS-based tools?</li>
<li>Terminology for language-oriented applications. Common ground and differences in knowledge organisation approaches between terminology and information retrieval communities.</li>
<li>Terminology registry. What are the range of services that a terminology registry might offer and what role can it play as a shared infrastructure service? We need to identify and specify use cases and sustainable business models.</li>
<li>Terminology services. We need to identify and specify terminology services for different applications, within a service-oriented approach/architecture, building on the basic infrastructure.</li>
<li>KOS Interoperability. Cross-browsing and cross-searching between distributed KOS services, mapping between terms, classes and systems, mapping between KOS and ontologies.</li>
<li>User-centred design issues.  User-centred design strategies for KOS. How to develop understandable and thorough descriptions of concepts and terms? How to show and explain relationships?</li>
