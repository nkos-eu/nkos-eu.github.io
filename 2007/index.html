<h3><a name="abstract"></a>Extended Abstract</h3>
<p>
We propose a full-day workshop of projects, research, and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (NKOS) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended NKOS workshops at ECDL 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006. We would expect 40 attendees at this workshop. The proposal is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classifications, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri, attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain. Modern digital information systems afford more options for mapping and presenting alternative orders of information than traditional physical libraries. The digital environment offers more possibilities of presenting information from different interests and discourses. Thus, the challenge is as much intellectual as technical when we want to develop knowledge organization systems that are useful and meaningful for the end-users operating in complex, interdisciplinary knowledge domains. The workshop would address the following general themes, although we will also remain open to emergent issues and plan to reserve a session for areas emerging from presentation proposals:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Social tagging</em></strong>. Participative user-based approaches to knowledge organization and cataloguing are emerging and attracting significant community support. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS?</li>
<li><strong><em>Semantic Web applications and implications of KOS</em></strong>. How can KOS contribute to Semantic Web efforts and conversely how can Semantic Web standards and technologies facilitate novel KOS applications and semantic interoperability research. What are the next steps for SKOS-based tools?</li>
<li><strong><em>Terminology for language-oriented applications</em></strong>. Common ground and differences in knowledge organisation approaches between terminology and information retrieval communities.</li>
<li><strong><em>Terminology registry</em></strong>. What are the range of services that a terminology registry might offer and what role can it play as a shared infrastructure service? We need to identify and specify use cases and sustainable business models.</li>
<li><strong><em>Terminology services</em></strong>. We need to identify and specify terminology services for different applications, within a service-oriented approach/architecture, building on the basic infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong><em>KOS Interoperability</em></strong>. Cross-browsing and cross-searching between distributed KOS services, mapping between terms, classes and systems, mapping between KOS and ontologies.</li>
<li><strong><em>User-centred design issues</em></strong>. User-centred design strategies for KOS. How to develop understandable and thorough descriptions of concepts and terms? How to show and explain relationships?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Brief description of the workshop</strong><br />
The 6th NKOS workshop at ECDL explores the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classifications, gazetteers, lexical databases, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri. These attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, semantic web. The workshop provides an opportunity to report and discuss projects, research, and development related to Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services in next-generation digital libraries.</p>

<h3><a name="structure"></a>Workshop Structure</h3>
<p>
An open call for papers will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and demonstrations. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process. The organisers and program committee will promote the workshop through their various contacts and discussion lists.
</p>
<p>Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours, including lunch and breaks:</p>
<p>
<strong>Session 1:</strong> Welcome and introduction (hrs 0:30)<br />
<strong>Session 2:</strong> Presentations drawing on user and application oriented themes outlined above (hrs: 2)<br />
<strong>Session 3:</strong> Open Session without predefined topic for issues emerging from the cfp (hrs: 1)<br />
<strong>Session 4:</strong> Presentations focusing on technical and standards related issues (hrs: 2)<br />
<strong>Session 5:</strong> Briefing session in which emergent issues may be presented and discussed (hrs 1)<br />
<strong>Session 6:</strong> Concluding directed discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0.30)<br />
</p>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website.
</p>
<p>
Previous NKOS workshops have resulted in journal special issues (see References). Authors presenting significant results at the workshop will be encouraged to submit papers for consideration in a future issue of the Journal of Digital Information (Koch and Tudhope are JoDI theme editors for Information Discovery).
