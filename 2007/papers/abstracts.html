<strong>Kinds of Tags: a collaborative research study on tag usage and structure</strong><br />
KoT (Kinds of Tags) is an ongoing joint collaborative research effort with many participants worldwide,
including the University of Minho, UKOLN, the University of Bologna, the Université Libre de Bruxelles
and La Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. It is focused on the analysis of tags that are in common use in
the practice of social tagging, with the aim of discovering how easily tags can be ‘normalised’ for
interoperability with standard metadata environments such as the DC Metadata Terms.<br />

<strong>Trend Analysis in Social Tagging: An LIS Perspective</strong><br />

<p>Stella Dextre Clarke – Panel Subsession Proposal<br />
<strong>Project ISO NP 25964: Structured vocabularies for information retrieval</strong><br />
ISO 2788 and ISO 5964, the international standards for monolingual and multilingual
thesauri respectively dated 1986 and 1985, are very much in need of revision. A proposal
to revise them was recently approved by the relevant subcommittee, ISO TC46/SC9. The
work will be based on BS 8723, a five part standard of which Parts 1 and 2 were
published in 2005, Parts 3 and 4 are scheduled for publication in 2007, and Part 5 is still
in draft.
This subsession will address aspects of the whole revision project. It is conceived as a
panel session starting with a brief overview from the project leader. Then there are three
presentations of 15 minutes, plus 5 minutes each for specific questions. At the end we
have 20 minutes for questions to any or all of the panel, and discussion of issues from the
workshop participants.<br />

<strong>Facet analysis as a fundamental theory for structuring subject organization tools</strong><br />
The presentation will examine the potential of facet analysis as a basis for determining
status and relationships of concepts in subject based tools using a controlled vocabulary,
and the extent to which it can be used as a general theory of knowledge organization as
opposed to a methodology for structuring classifications only.<br />

<strong>Towards the “webification” of controlled subject vocabulary: A case study involving the Dewey Decimal Classification</strong><br />
The presentation will briefly introduce a series of major principles for bringing subject
terminology to the network level. A closer look at one KOS in particular, the Dewey
Decimal Classification, should help to gain more insight into the perceived difficulties
and potential benefits of building taxonomy services out and on top of classic large-scale
vocabularies or taxonomies.<br />

<p>With the increasing requirement of establishing semantic mappings between different vocabularies, further development of  these encoding formats is becoming more and more important.  For this reason, four types of knowledge representation formats were assessed:MARC21 for Classification Data in XML, Zthes XML Schema, XTM(XML Topic Map), and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organisation System).  This paper explores the potential of adapting these representation formats to support different semantic mapping methods, and discusses the implication of extending them to represent more complex KOS.<br />

<strong>Uniform SPARQL Access to Interlinked (Digital Library) Sources</strong><br />
In this presentation, we therefore focus on a solution for providing uniform access to Digital Libraries
and other online services. In order to enable uniform query access to heterogeneous sources, we must
provide metadata interoperability in a way that a query language – in this case SPARQL – can cope with
the incompatibility of the metadata in various sources without changing their already existing
information models.<br />

<strong>Collaborative Building of Controlled Vocabulary Crosswalks</strong><br />
One of the main features of classic libraries is metadata, which also is the key aspect of the
Semantic Web. Librarians in the process of resources annotation use different kinds of
Knowledge Organization Systems; KOS range from controlled vocabularies to classifications
and categories (e.g., taxonomies) and to relationship lists (e.g., thesauri). The diversity of
controlled vocabularies, used by various libraries and organizations, became a bottleneck for
efficient information exchange between different entities. Even though a simple one-to-one
mapping could be established, based on the similarities between names of concepts, we
cannot derive information about the hierarchy between concepts from two different KOS.
One of the solutions to this problem is to create an algorithm based on data delivered by large
community of users using many classification schemata at once. The rationale behind it is
that similar resources can be described by equivalent concepts taken from different
taxonomies. The more annotations are collected, the more precise the result of this crosswalk
will be.<br />
