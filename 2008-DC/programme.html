 <h1>NKOS Special Session at DCMI 2008<h1> 
 <h2>September 24, Berlin, Germany</h2>
 
  <h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
The presentations in a NKOS session aim to cover the intersection between NKOS and metadata, especially the main topic of the conference: Metadata for Semantic and Social Applications. They should demonstrate what NKOSwork could contribute to metadata solutions and issues.
</p>
<p>
There will be three hours available for a NKOS special session (plus a half hour break). The successful formula 2005 was to feature three main presenters and to allow half of the session time for discussion related to each presentation. 
</p>
<p>
This time, we plan to feature one main presentation on each topic, followed by a comprehensive discussion lead by a discussant/enabler/opponent. Hopefully, colleagues from different communities can be involved in each topic.
</p>
  
 <h4>Workshop Programme</h4>
 <p>The slides are available as a <a target="_blank" href="nkos-2008-dc.pdf">single PDF file (16 MB)</a></p>
