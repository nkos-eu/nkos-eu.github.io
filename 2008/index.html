<h3><a name="abstract"></a>Brief description of the workshop</h3>
<p>
The 7th NKOS workshop at ECDL explores the potential of Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS), such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases. These tools attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the semantic web. The workshop provides an opportunity to report and discuss projects, research, and development related to Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services in next-generation digital libraries.
</p>
<p>
The workshop would address the general themes presented below, although the workshop is not limited to the predefined topics and remains open to other issues emerging from presentation proposals: 
<ul>
<li>KOS Interoperability. Intellectual and automatic methods for vocabulary mapping on concept as well as term level. Cross-browsing and cross-searching between distributed KOS services, Mapping between KOS and ontologies.</li>
<li>Terminology registry. What is the range of services that a terminology registry might offer and what role can it play as a shared infrastructure service? We need to identify and specify use cases and sustainable business models.</li>
<li>Terminology services. We need to identify and specify terminology services for different applications, within a service-oriented approach/architecture, building on the basic infrastructure.</li>
<li>User-centred design issues. User-centred design strategies for KOS. How to develop understandable and thorough descriptions of concepts and terms? How to show and explain relationships? Cost effective methods to collect and organise user oriented and domain-specific conceptual information.</li> 
<li>Social tagging. Participative user-based approaches to knowledge organization and description are emerging and attracting significant community support. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? How do the methods complement each other? Is it possible or desirable to obtain some degree of control in social tagging systems?</li>
<li>Semantic Web applications and implications of KOS. How can KOS contribute to Semantic Web efforts and conversely how can Semantic Web standards and technologies facilitate novel KOS applications and semantic interoperability research. What are the next steps for SKOS-based tools?</li> 
<li>Terminology for language-oriented applications. Common ground and differences in knowledge organisation approaches between terminology and information retrieval communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, a poster session, and a concluding directed discussion. We welcome submissions of extended abstracts, for details see <a href="call-for-papers.html">call for papers</a>
</p>

<p align="right"><small><a href="#top">Back to top</a></small></p>

<h3><a name="structure"></a>Workshop Structure</h3>
<p>
An open call for papers and posters will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and demonstrations. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, a poster session, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process. The organisers and program committee will promote the workshop through their various contacts and discussion lists.
</p>
<p>
Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours, including lunch and breaks:
</p>
<p>
<strong>Session 1:</strong> Welcome and introduction (hrs 0:30)<br />
<strong>Session 2:</strong> Presentations drawing on user and application oriented themes outlined above (hrs: 2)<br /> 
<strong>Session 3:</strong> Open Session without predefined topic for issues emerging from the cfp (hrs: 1)<br /> 
<strong>Session 4:</strong> Presentations focusing on technical and standards related issues (hrs: 2)<br /> 
<strong>Session 5:</strong> Poster session with short presentations, mingling and discussions (hrs 1)<br /> 
<strong>Session 6:</strong> Concluding directed discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0.30)<br />
</p>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website.
</p>
<p>
Previous NKOS workshops have resulted in journal special issues (see References). Authors presenting significant results at the workshop will be encouraged to submit papers for consideration in future issues of the Journal of Digital Information (Koch and Tudhope are JoDI theme editors for Information Discovery) and New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (Tudhope is Editor).
