<h2>Call for Presentations and Participation</h2>
<p>
The 8th NKOS Workshop at the European Digital Library Conference will take place on Thursday 1st October, as part of ECDL 2009 in Corfu (<a href="http://www.ecdl2009.eu/">http://www.ecdl2009.eu/</a>). Two important new themes are Linked Data and KOS development methods. This year’s workshop also invites proposals for posters.
</p>

<p>
Proposals are invited for the following:
<ol>
<li>presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion time, potentially longer if the substance and importance warrant it) on work or projects related to the themes of the workshop (see below) or to NKOS more generally. The traditionally reflective style of the NKOS workshops allows time for discussion.</li>
<li>posters (first time in NKOS, as part of Session 5) on work or projects related to the themes of the workshop (see below) or to NKOS more generally, with time allowed for discussion. </li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>Please email proposals (approximately 500 words for presentations and 200 words for posters, including aims, methods, main findings) by June 23rd to Koraljka Golub (<a href="mailto:k.golub@ukoln.ac.uk">k.golub@ukoln.ac.uk</a>). Advance indication that you intend to submit would be helpful. Proposals will be peer-reviewed by the program committee and notification of acceptance will be given by July 3rd. The early registration deadline for the conference and the workshop is July 31st.
</p>

<h3>Topics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Linked data</strong> on the Web. How can KOS contribute to move towards the linked data applications? What are the next steps for SKOS-based tools? What kinds of KOS-based services are needed to take advantage of linked data?</li>
<li><strong>Models and methodologies for creation and development of KOS</strong>, its vocabulary and relations, and connected services. How to structure the development process? What variables to study about the information content, information environment and context, and future users? What methods to apply to capture the needed domain knowledge? How can Web 2.0 methods, including trust networks, co-references, distribution etc. influence and contribute to KOS construction?</li>
<li><strong>Social tagging.</strong> What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by KOS?</li>
<li><strong>KOS Interoperability.</strong> Intellectual and automatic methods for vocabulary mapping on concept as well as term level. Cross-browsing and cross-searching between distributed KOS services. Cross-media retrieval and KOS.</li> 
<li><strong>Terminology services.</strong> What is the range of services that a terminology registry might offer and what role can it play as a shared infrastructure service?</li>
<li><strong>User-centred design issues.</strong> User-centred design strategies for KOS. How to develop understandable and thorough descriptions of concepts and terms? How to show and explain relationships? </li>
<li><strong>Semantic Web</strong> applications and implications of KOS, in particular SKOS- and OWL-based applications. How can KOS contribute to Semantic Web efforts and vice-versa?</li>
<li><strong>Economic and social issues</strong> in the context of KOS creation, maintenance and application. Feasibility of KOS development methods. Efficiency of KOS application in different contexts. Bias in KOS and consequent interoperability issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Other NKOS topics can also be proposed. For inspiration, please visit the NKOS network website at: <a href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/</a>.
