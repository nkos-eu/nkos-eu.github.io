<h2>Workshop Proposal</h2>
<p>
The 9th NKOS workshop at ECDL explores the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases. These tools attempt to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the semantic web. The workshop provides an opportunity to report and discuss projects, research, and development related to Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services in next-generation digital libraries. 
</p>
<p>
ECDL is the established venue for reporting on European NKOS activities, complementing the US series of workshops. The workshop allows major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field and discussion of topical issues, requiring consensus or coordination, including standards efforts. Thus previous workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of BSI and ISO KOS standards, the W3C SKOS standard, the interface between traditional Library Science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, social tagging and its relation to established vocabulaties, KOS metadata and the different types of KOS. The ECDL venue affords participation by KOS researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as KOS design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of KOS in registries.
</p>

<h2>Workshop Structure</h2>
<p>
An open call for papers and posters (submission  deadline June 14, notification July 5) will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and demonstrations. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, a poster session, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process. The organisers and program committee will promote the workshop through their various contacts and discussion lists. 
</p>
<p>
Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours, including lunch and breaks:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Session 1: Welcome and introduction (hrs 0:30)</li>
	<li>Session 2: Presentations drawing on Mapping themes (hrs: 2)</li>
	<li>Session 3: Directed discussion emerging from the first session (hrs: 1)</li>
	<li>Session 4: Presentations focusing on Registries and metadata related issues (hrs: 2)</li>
	<li>Session 5: Directed discussion emerging from the second session (hrs 1)</li>
	<li>Session 6: Concluding directed discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0.30)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website. 
</p>
<p>
Previous NKOS workshops have resulted in journal special issues (see References). Authors presenting significant results at the workshop will be encouraged to submit papers for consideration in future issues of the International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL – Koch is a member of the Editorial Board) and the New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (Tudhope is Editor, and Koch, Nielsen are on the Editorial Board) depending on the candidate papers.
