<h3>Call for Presentations and demos</h3>
<p>
The 10th European NKOS workshop will take place as part of TPDL (formerly ECDL) 2011 in Berlin, Germany.
</p>

<h3>Important Dates:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Submission deadline: 26th June 2011</li>
	<li>Notification of acceptance: 17th July 2011</li>
	<li>Workshop: 28th-29th September 2011</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposals are invited for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion time, potentially
longer if warranted) on work related to the themes of the workshop (see
below).</li>
<li>Demos on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below).</li>
</ol>
<p>
Please email proposals (maximum 1000 words for presentations and 500
words for demos, including aims, methods, main findings and underlying
work, relevance to themes of workshop) by June 26th to Traugott Koch
(<a href="mailto:traugott.koch@mpdl.mpg.de">traugott.koch@mpdl.mpg.de</a>). Proposals will be peer-reviewed by the
programme committee and notification of acceptance will be given by July
17th.
</p>
<p>
After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on
the workshop website. Presentations from the workshop may be encouraged
to be submitted as extended papers for peer reviewed journal publication.
</p>
<p>
Themes for the 10th NKOS workshop will be:
</p>
<p>
Proposed session on the two interrelated issues
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Relation between ontologies and (other) KOS. Exploring the relationship between formal ontologies, a type of KOS
designed to support reasoning and other operations executed by computer
programs, and KOS to support sensemaking by people. Is there a
difference in content or just in presentation? Relationship of domain
thesauri to upper ontologies such as the CIDOC CRM.
</li>
<li>
From KOS to formal ontologies and back? Repurposing and reengineering
of KOS (for other usage scenarios than indexing).
The session should investigate, based on practical experiences,
motivations and approaches of repurposing of KOS, the resulting
varieties of formal ontologies, problems and potential benefits. An
issue should as well be upgrades and benefits in the opposite direction,
from “enriched” ontologies to the originating and contributing KOS.
</li>
<p>
Further timely topics for submissions include:
</p>
<li>
Management and integration of multiple vocabulary types, such as
thesauri, terminologies, synonym rings etc.
</li>
<li>
SKOS extensions. What extensions to SKOS would be needed to cover
advanced mapping and vocabulary integration, additional KOS types and
other actual requirements?
</li>
<li>
Library Linked Data: Linking KOS data on the web.
How can KOS contribute to move towards the linked data applications?
What kinds of KOS-based services are needed to take advantage of linked
data?
How to keep the meaning of (disambiguated) terms in linked data?
</li>
<p>
A regular and important area of topics in NKOS workshops are
applications of KOS. This year, one or more of the following are
especially welcome:
</p>
<li>
KOS in e-Science metadata contexts. The intersection between research
data, KOS and Semantic web is in the focus here.
</li>
<li>
Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal
knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided
and informed by KOS? The possible contribution of social tagging and
informal knowledge structures to constructing and augmenting established
KOS. Implications for social search.
</li>
<li>
Design and implementation of KOS for extended roles in networked
systems; roles, such as access points in information retrieval,
description and understanding of content, tool for personalization or
automated categorization.
</li>
<li>
Users interaction with KOS in the networked environment.
</li>
<li>
Quality issues in web-based KOS. How to identify and detect
shortcomings in data quality and what to do to improve KOS on the web?
</li>
<li>
KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey
meaning, to assist users to express their information needs, to assist
in sensemaking and learning?
</li>
<p>
Other NKOS topics can also be proposed. For inspiration, please visit
