*Themes* for the 11th NKOS workshop will be:<br/>
1) KOS requirements and applications in cultural heritage. Cultural heritage has been an important application domain for KOS and often a driver for KOS standards. KOS specific issues within the Europeana range of projects are also relevant here.
</p>

<p>
2) Linked data applications of KOS and LOV (Linking and Opening Vocabularies). We are seeing the recognition that the different types of KOS can act as hubs within linked data networks. Reports of practical experience are particularly welcome.
</p>

<p>
Further timely presentations/demonstrations could be selected from the following topics:
</p>

<p>
3) Management and integration of multiple vocabulary types, such as classification systems, thesauri, terminologies, synonym rings etc. Typologies and spectra of KOS. KOS Registries.
</p>

<p>
4) SKOS extensions. What extensions to SKOS would be needed to cover advanced mapping and vocabulary integration, additional KOS types and other actual requirements?
</p>

<p>
KOS applications are a regular and important part of NKOS workshops. Example topics include:
</p>

<p>
5) KOS in e-Research metadata contexts. The intersection between research data, KOS and Semantic web.
</p>

<p>
6) Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by KOS? The possible 
contribution of social tagging and informal knowledge structures to constructing  / augmenting established KOS. Implications for social search.
</p>

<p>
7) Users interaction with KOS in the online environment, visualisation issues.
</p>

<p>
8) Quality issues in web-based KOS. How to identify and detect shortcomings in data quality and what to do to improve KOS on the web?  Issues concerning large metadata sets. Version management.
</p>

<p>
9) KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sensemaking and learning?
</p>

<p>
10) Multilingual and Interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.
</p>

<p>
11) Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.
</p>
