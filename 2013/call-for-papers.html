<p>
<h3>Themes for the 12th NKOS workshop will be:</h3>
1) <strong>Meaningful Concept Display and Meaningful Visualization of KOS.</strong> Visualization has been an important application domain for KOS and often a driver for KOS use in Digital Libraries. Reports of innovative demonstrators, implementation issues and evaluation studies with real users are particularly welcome.
</p>

<p>
2) <strong>KOS-based recommender systems.</strong> We are seeing the utilization of KOS-based search term recommender systems as a semantic hub in DL. The suggestion of the right meaningful concepts is a mission critical phase for searchers in modern DL. We want to discuss both perspectives: the consumptive side of the user and the technical side of DL operators. Reports of practical experience, implementation issues and evaluation studies are particularly welcome.
</p>

<p>
Further timely presentations/demonstrations could be selected from the following topics:
</p>

<p>
3) Management and integration of multiple vocabulary types, such as classification systems, thesauri, terminologies, synonym rings etc. Typologies and spectra of KOS. KOS Registries.
</p>

<p>
4) SKOS extensions. What extensions to SKOS would be needed to cover advanced mapping and vocabulary integration, additional KOS types and other actual requirements?
</p>

<p>
KOS applications are a regular and important part of NKOS workshops. Example topics include:
</p>

<p>
5) KOS in e-Research metadata contexts. The intersection between research data, KOS and Semantic web.
</p>

<p>
6) Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by KOS? The possible 
contribution of social tagging and informal knowledge structures to constructing  / augmenting established KOS. Implications for social search.
</p>

<p>
7) Users interaction with KOS in the online environment, visualisation issues.
</p>

<p>
8) Quality issues in web-based KOS. How to identify and detect shortcomings in data quality and what to do to improve KOS on the web?  Issues concerning large metadata sets. Version management.
</p>

<p>
9) KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sensemaking and learning?
</p>

<p>
10) Multilingual and Interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.
</p>

<p>
11) Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.
</p>

<p>
Other NKOS topics can also be proposed. For inspiration, please visit the NKOS network website at: <a href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/</a>
