<h3>Call for Presentations and demos</h3>

<p itemprop="description"><strong>The 13<sup>th</sup> European NKOS workshop</strong> will take place on the afternoon of Thursday 11<sup>th</sup> September and the morning of Friday 12<sup>th</sup> September as part of <span itemprop="superEvent">DL2014 (joint JCDL/TPDL conferences)</span> in <span itemprop="location">London</span>.</p>

<h3>Important Dates:</h3>
<ul>
<!--<li>Submission deadline: Monday 23<sup>rd</sup> June 2014</li>-->
<li>Submission deadline: Friday 4<sup>th</sup> July 2014</li>
<li>Notification of acceptance: Monday 21<sup>st</sup> July 2014</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposals are invited for the following:</p>

<p>a) Presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion time, potentially longer if warranted) on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below). An option for a short 5 minute project report presentation is also possible.</p>

<p>b) Demos on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below).</p>

<p>Please email proposals (maximum 1000 words for presentations and 500 words for demos, including aims, methods, main findings and underlying work, relevance to themes of workshop) to Douglas Tudhope (<a href="mailto:douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk&amp;subject=NKOS2014%20submission">douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk</a>). Proposals will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. At least one presentation author needs to register for the workshop by Monday 4th August (this is a strict requirement).</p>

<p>After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the workshop website. Presentations from the workshop may be encouraged to be submitted as extended papers for peer reviewed journal publication.</p>

<h3>Themes for the 13<sup>th</sup> NKOS workshop will be:</h3>
<p>1) Mapping between Linked Data vocabularies.<br>
This last year has seen a major growth in Linked Data publication of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>. How can we encourage and support quality linking between this vocabularies. How should these mappings be described in metadata? What methods are appropriate for creating mappings? We need discussion of practical initiatives to link between congruent vocabularies and provide effective web services and APIs so that applications can build upon them.</p>

<p>2) Meaningful Concept Display and Meaningful Visualization of KOS. Visualization has been an important application domain for <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> and often a driver for KOS use in Digital Libraries. Reports of innovative demonstrators, implementation issues and evaluation studies with users are welcome.</p>

<p>3) Applications of KOS systems in relation to 'Big data' as natural language processing and semantic analysis of content pose huge challenges. The workshop can provide a venue for researchers of both big data and KOS to exchange ideas.</p>

<p>Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the CfP:</p>

<p>KOS applications are a regular and important part of NKOS workshops. Example topics include:</p>
<p>4) KOS-based recommender systems for suggestion of meaningful concepts.</p>
<p>5) KOS in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data, KOS, Semantic web.</p>
<p>6) Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS?</p>
<p>7) Users interaction with KOS in the online environment.</p>
<p>8) Quality issues in web-based KOS. Issues concerning large metadata sets. Version management.</p>
<p>9) KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?</p>
<p>10) Multilingual and Interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.</p>
<p>11) Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc</p>
