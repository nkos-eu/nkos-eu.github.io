<h3>Extended abstract</h3>
<p>
We propose a full-day workshop of research projects and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (NKOS) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended NKOS workshops at previous <abbr title="European Conference on Digital Libraries">ECDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries ">TPDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Conference on Digital Libraries">JCDL conferences</abbr> (see <a target="_blank" href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">NKOS website</a> for details). This is a joint proposal from US and European NKOS colleagues and would constitute the 11<sup>th</sup> US and 13<sup>th</sup> European NKOS workshop. We expect approximately 30 attendees at this workshop. The proposal is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website.
</p>
<p>
The workshop will be planned to complement a <abbr title="UK eInformation Group">UKeiG</abbr>/<abbr title="British chapter of International Society for Knowledge Organization">ISKO-UK</abbr>/<abbr title="British Computer Society - Information Retrieval Specialist Group">BCS-IRSG</abbr> event in London (the Tony Kent Strix Lecture, provisionally planned for the afternoon of 12<sup>th</sup>), with the workshop running on afternoon of Sept 11<sup>th</sup> and morning of 12<sup>th</sup>.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), in the form of classification systems, thesauri, lexical databases, ontologies, and taxonomies, play a crucial role in digital information management and applications generally. Carrying semantics in a well-controlled and documented way, Knowledge Organisation Systems serve a variety of important functions: tools for representation and indexing of information and documents, knowledge-based support to information searchers, semantic road maps to domains and disciplines, communication tool by providing conceptual framework, and conceptual basis for knowledge based systems, e.g. automated classification systems.
</p>
<h3>Brief description of the workshop and its aims</h3>
<p itemprop="description">
The proposed NKOS workshop at DL2014 will explore the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases in the context of current developments and possibilities. These tools help to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the Semantic Web. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential co-operation.
</p>
<p>
The joint conference offers an opportunity for the US and European NKOS communities to share experiences and reflections (in later years there have been separate US/EU workshops with some overlap of participants). The continuity provided by the long recognized series of NKOS workshops provides a basis for reconnecting with important project and research endeavours at regular intervals and receiving updates on new directions.
</p>
<p>
The workshop will also allow major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field and discussion of topical issues, requiring consensus or coordination, including standards efforts, to take place. Thus previous workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> and <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> KOS standards, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr> standard, the interface between traditional Library Science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, KOS linked data, social tagging and its relation to established vocabularies, KOS metadata and the different types of KOS. The DL venue affords participation by KOS researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as KOS design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of KOS in registries.
</p>
<p>
For details of the workshop themes, see the <a href="call-for-papers.html">call for papers</a>.
</p>

<h3>Workshop structure</h3>
<p>
An open call for papers and demonstrations (submission deadline 4<sup>th</sup> July, notification 21<sup>st</sup> July) will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and professional societies with an interest in this field. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, demonstrations, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process and promote the workshop through the workshop website, their various contacts and discussion lists, including the NKOS list and digital library lists.
</p>

	</li>
</ul>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website. Authors presenting significant results at the workshop will be encouraged to submit papers for consideration in future issues of the International Journal on Digital Libraries and the New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (Tudhope is Editor) depending on the candidate papers.
