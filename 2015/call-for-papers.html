<h3>Call for Presentations and demos</h3>

<p><strong>The 14<sup>th</sup> European Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) workshop</strong> will take place on Friday 18<sup>th</sup> September 2015 as part of <a target="_blank" href="http://tpdl2015.info/">TPDL2015 Conference</a> in Pozna&#324;, Poland.</p>

<h3>Important Dates:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Submission deadline extended: Sunday 19<sup>th</sup> July 2015</li>
	<li>Notification of acceptance: Monday 17<sup>th</sup> August 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposals are invited for the following:</p>

<p>a) Presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion time, potentially longer if warranted) on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below). An option for a short 5 minute project report presentation is also possible.</p>

<p>b) Demos on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below).</p>

<p>Please email proposals (maximum 1000 words for presentations and 500 words for demos, including aims, methods, main findings and underlying work, relevance to themes of workshop) to Douglas Tudhope (<a href="mailto:douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk&amp;subject=NKOS2015%20submission">douglas.tudhope@southwales.ac.uk</a>). Proposals will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. At least one presentation author needs to register for the workshop (this is a strict requirement).</p>

<p>After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the workshop website. Presentations from the workshop may be encouraged to be submitted as extended papers for peer reviewed journal publication.</p>

<h3>Themes for the NKOS workshop will be:</h3>
<p>
1) KOS Alignment. KOS alignment or terminology mapping plays a vital role in NKOS for many years and fits very well to the general theme "Connecting Digital Collections" of TPDL 2015. This year we want to sort out the needs (use cases) of KOS alignments in the new environment of Linked Open Data. We plan to collect methodologies, best practices, guidelines and tools. This includes manual and automatic alignments.
</p>
<p>
2) KOS Linked Open Data. Recent years have seen an increasing trend to publication of KOS as Linked Data vocabularies. We need discussion of practical initiatives to link between congruent vocabularies and provide effective web services and APIs so that applications can build upon them.
</p>
<p>
3) Applications of KOS systems in relation to 'Big data' - natural language processing and semantic analysis of content pose huge challenges.
</p>
<p>
Further presentations/demonstrations will be selected from current KOS applications, including:
</p>
<p>4) KOS-based recommender systems for suggestion of meaningful concepts.</p>
<p>5) KOS in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data, KOS, Semantic web.</p>
<p>6) Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS?</p>
<p>7) Users interaction with KOS in the online environment.</p>
<p>8) Quality issues in web-based KOS. Issues concerning large metadata sets. Version management.</p>
<p>9) KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?</p>
<p>10) Multilingual and Interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.</p>
<p>11) Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc</p>

<p>More information on the workshop can be found in the <a href="proposal.html">workshop proposal</a></p>
