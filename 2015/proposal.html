<h3>Extended abstract</h3>

<p>
We propose a full-day workshop of research projects and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (NKOS) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended NKOS workshops at previous <abbr title="European Conference on Digital Libraries">ECDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries ">TPDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Conference on Digital Libraries">JCDL</abbr> conferences (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">NKOS website</a> for details). We expect approximately 30 attendees at this workshop. The proposal is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website.
</p>

<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), in the form of classification systems, thesauri, lexical databases, ontologies, and taxonomies, play a crucial role in digital information management and applications generally. Carrying semantics in a well-controlled and documented way, Knowledge Organisation Systems serve a variety of important functions: tools for representation and indexing of information and documents, knowledge-based support to information searchers, semantic road maps to domains and disciplines, communication tool by providing conceptual framework, and conceptual basis for knowledge based systems, e.g. automated classification systems.
</p>

<h3>Brief description of the workshop and its aims</h3>
<p itemprop="description">
The proposed NKOS workshop at TPDL2015 will explore the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases in the context of current developments and possibilities. These tools help to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the Semantic Web. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential co-operation.
</p>

<p>
The workshop will also allow major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field and discussion of topical issues, requiring consensus or coordination, including standards efforts, to take place. Thus previous workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> and <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> KOS standards, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr> standard, the interface between traditional Library Science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, KOS linked data, social tagging and its relation to established vocabularies, KOS metadata and the different types of KOS. The TPDL venue affords participation by KOS researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as KOS design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of KOS in registries.
</p>
<p>
The proposed workshop will have two themes as the main focus, together with topical presentations arising from the workshop call for presentations.
</p>

<h3>Workshop themes</h3>
<p>
1) <strong>KOS Alignment</strong>. KOS alignment or terminology mapping plays a vital role in NKOS for many years and fits very well to the general theme “Connecting Digital Collections” of TPDL 2015. This year we want to sort out the needs (use cases) of KOS alignments in the new environment of Linked Open Data. We plan to collect methodologies, best practices, guidelines and tools. This includes manual and automatic alignments.
</p>
<p>
2) <strong>KOS Linked Open Data</strong>. Recent years have seen an increasing trend to publication of KOS as Linked Data vocabularies. We need discussion of practical initiatives to link between congruent vocabularies and provide effective web services and APIs so that applications can build upon them.
</p>
<p>
Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the CfP:
</p>
<p>
3) KOS-based recommender systems. The suggestion of the right meaningful concepts is a mission critical phase for searchers in modern DL.
</p>
<p>
4) Meaningful Concept Display and Meaningful Visualization of KOS.
</p>
<p>
5) Standards developments.
</p>
<p>
6) Evaluation of KOS-based systems – methods and practical experience.
</p>
<p>
KOS applications are a regular and important part of NKOS workshops. Example topics include:
</p>
<p>
7) KOS in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data, KOS, Semantic web.
</p>
<p>
8) Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by KOS?
</p>
<p>
9) Users interaction with KOS in the online environment. 
</p>
<p>
10) KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?
</p>
<p>
11) Multilingual and Interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.
</p>
<p>
12) Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.
</p>








<h3>Workshop structure</h3>
<p>
An open <a href="call-for-papers.html">call for papers and demonstrations</a> will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and professional societies with an interest in this field. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, demonstrations, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process and promote the workshop through the workshop website, their various contacts and discussion lists, including the NKOS list and digital library lists.
</p>
<p><strong>Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Session 1: Welcome, introduction, mutual presentations (hrs 0:30)</li>
	<li>Session 2: Presentations on the main themes (hrs: 2)</li>
	<li>Session 3: Directed discussion emerging from the main session (hrs: 1)</li>
	<li>Session 4: Presentation and discussion of submitted papers on timely and related topics according to the <a href="call-for-papers.html">call for papers</a>, including demonstrations (hrs: 2)</li>
	<li>Session 5: Directed discussion emerging from the session 4 (hrs 1)</li>
	<li>Session 6: Concluding discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0.30)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website. Authors presenting significant results at the workshop will be encouraged to submit papers for consideration in future issues of the International Journal on Digital Libraries and the New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia (Tudhope is Editor) depending on the candidate papers.
