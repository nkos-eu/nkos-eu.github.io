<h3>Call for Presentations and demos</h3>

<p><strong>The 16<sup>th</sup> European Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) workshop</strong> will take place on Saturday 15th October as part of DC 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
<p>

<h4>Important Dates</h4>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: Friday, 1 July 2016</li>
<li>Notification of acceptance: Tuesday, 16th August 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>Proposals are invited for the following:</p>
<p> 
a) Presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion time, potentially longer if warranted) on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below). An option for a short 5 minute project report presentation is also possible.
</p>
<p>
b) Demos on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below).
</p>
<p>
Please email proposals (maximum 1000 words for presentations and 500 words for demos, including aims, methods, main findings and underlying work, relevance to themes of workshop) to Koraljka Golub (<a href="mailto:koraljka.golub@lnu.se">koraljka.golub@lnu.se</a>). Proposals will be peer-reviewed by the program committee. At least one presentation author needs to register for the workshop (this is a strict requirement).
</p>
<p>
After the workshop, copies of both proposals and presentations will be made available on the workshop website as well as be subject to the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://dcevents.dublincore.org/IntConf/dc-2016/about/submissions#copyrightNotice">DCMI copyright provisions</a>. Presentations from the workshop may be encouraged to be submitted as extended papers for a peer reviewed journal publication.
</p>
<h4>Themes for the 16th NKOS workshop will be:</h4>
<ol>
<li>KOS Alignment. KOS alignment or terminology mapping plays a vital role in NKOS for many years. This year we want to sort out the needs (use cases) of KOS alignments in the new environment of Linked Open Data. We plan to collect methodologies, best practices, guidelines and tools. This includes manual and automatic alignments.</li>
<li>KOS Linked Open Data. Recent years have seen an increasing trend to publication of KOS as Linked Data vocabularies. We need discussion of practical initiatives to link between congruent vocabularies and provide effective web services and APIs so that applications can build upon them.</li>
<li>Subject metadata for research data. With increasing recognition of the need to manage research data as part of universities research output, subject metadata represent particular challenges that need to be addressed from theoretical as well as practical perspectives. We plan to discuss existing issues, especially in terms of interoperability across disciplines as well as applications, and strive towards establishment of best practices and guidelines.</li>
<p>Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the CfP:</p>
<li>KOS-based recommender systems. The suggestion of the right meaningful concepts is a mission critical phase for searchers in modern DL.</li>
<li>Meaningful Concept Display and Meaningful Visualization of KOS.</li>
<li>Standards developments.</li>
<li>Evaluation of KOS-based systems – methods and practical experience.</li>
KOS applications are a regular and important part of NKOS workshops. Example topics include:</li>
<li>KOS in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data, KOS, Semantic web.</li>
<li>Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by KOS?</li>
<li>Users interaction with KOS in the online environment.</li>
<li>KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?</li>
<li>Multilingual and Interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.</li>
<li>Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.</li>
</ol>
