</p>
<p>
Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop proceedings publication service (ISSN 1613-0073) - This way the proceedings will be permanently available and citable (digital persistent identifiers and long term preservation).
</p>
<p>
After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the workshop website. Presentations from the workshop may be encouraged to be submitted as extended papers for peer reviewed journal publication.
</p>
<p>We invite submissions for:</p>
<p>
a) Presentations (typically 20 minutes plus discussion time, potentially longer if warranted) on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below). An option for a short 5 minute project report presentation is also possible.
</p>
<p>
b) Demos on work related to the themes of the workshop (see below).
</p>
<p>
We especially invite descriptions of running projects and ongoing work. Papers that investigate multiple themes directly are especially welcome.
</p>
<h4>Themes for the NKOS workshop will be:</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> Alignment</strong>. <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> alignment or terminology mapping plays a vital role in <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organisation Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> for many years and fits very well to the general theme “Overcoming the Limits of Digital Archives” of <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> 2016. This year we want to sort out the needs (use cases) of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> alignments in the new environment of Linked Open Data. We plan to collect methodologies, best practices, guidelines and tools. This includes manual and automatic alignments.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> Linked Open Data</strong>. Recent years have seen an increasing trend to publication of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> as Linked Data vocabularies. We need discussion of practical initiatives to link between congruent vocabularies and provide effective web services and APIs so that applications can build upon them.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> and Document Retrieval</strong>. Documents or parts of documents are nowadays not only accessible via their metadata but their abstracts and in many cases the full texts are electronically available. Thus, these documents also can be found by search engines. Given this possibility of full text search the role of classification and annotation has to be redefined. Questions like the following ones arise: can traditional knowledge organization and document annotation improve full text retrieval? Are classification, categorisation, annotation, tagging, and full text retrieval complementary, or how can they be made complementary? What should be the focus of annotation, if full text retrieval is available?<br><br>Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the call for papers:</li>
<li><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>-based recommender systems. The suggestion of the right meaningful concepts is a mission critical phase for searchers in modern <abbr title="Digital Libraries">DL</abbr>.</li>
<li>Meaningful Concept Display and Meaningful Visualization of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>.</li>
<li>Standards developments.</li>
<li>Evaluation of <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>-based systems – methods and practical experience.<br><br><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> applications are a regular and important part of <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organisation Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> workshops. Example topics include:</li>
<li><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data, <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>, Semantic web.</li>
<li>Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr>?</li>
<li>Users interaction with <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> in the online environment.</li>
<li><abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> and learning. What is required to use <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?</li> 
<li>Multilingual and Interdisciplinary <abbr title="Knowledge Organisation Systems">KOS</abbr> applications and tools.</li>
<li>Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.</li>
</ol>
