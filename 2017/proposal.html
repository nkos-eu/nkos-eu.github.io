<h3>Extended abstract</h3>
<p>
We propose a full-day workshop of research projects and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (<abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr>) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> workshops at previous <abbr title="European Conference on Digital Libraries">ECDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries ">TPDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Conference on Digital Libraries">JCDL</abbr>, Dublin Core conferences (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/"><abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> website</a> for details). We expect approximately 30 attendees at this workshop. The proposal is supported by the international <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website. 
</p>
<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems (<abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>), in the form of classification systems, thesauri, lexical databases, ontologies, and taxonomies, play a crucial role in digital information management and applications generally. Carrying semantics in a well-controlled and documented way, Knowledge Organization Systems serve a variety of important functions: tools for representation and indexing of information and documents, knowledge-based support to information searchers, semantic road maps to domains and disciplines, communication tool by providing conceptual framework, and conceptual basis for knowledge based systems, e.g. automated classification systems.
</p>
<h3>Brief description of the workshop and its aims</h3>
<p>
The proposed <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> workshop at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.tpdl.eu/tpdl2017/"><abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr>2017</a> will explore the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems, such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases in the context of current developments and possibilities. These tools help to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the semantic web. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential co-operation. 
</p>
<p>
The workshop will also allow major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field and discussion of topical issues, requiring consensus or coordination, including standards efforts, to take place. Thus previous workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> and <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> standards, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr> standard, the interface between traditional Library Science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> linked data, social tagging and its relation to established vocabularies, <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> metadata and the different types of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>. The <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> venue affords participation by <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> in registries. In 2016 we have published a special issue on Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services in the international journal <abbr title="International Journal of Digital Libraries">IJDL</abbr> (see Mayr et al. 2016). This special issue evolved from the 13th Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (<abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr>) workshop held at the joint Digital Libraries conference 2014 in London. We plan to have a next <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> special issue in <abbr title="International Journal of Digital Libraries">IJDL</abbr> in early 2018. Authors of accepted papers of the 15th and 16th workshop (at <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> 2016 and Dublin Core 2016) will be invited to submit extended papers to this <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> special issue.
</p>
<p>
The proposed workshop will have three themes as the main focus, together with topical presentations arising from the workshop call for presentations. 
</p>
<h3>Workshop themes</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> Alignment</strong>. <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> alignment or terminology mapping plays a vital role in <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> for many years. This year we want to sort out the needs (use cases) of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> alignments in the new environment of Linked Open Data. We plan to collect methodologies, best practices, guidelines and tools. This includes manual and automatic alignments.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> Linked Open Data</strong>. Recent years have seen an increasing trend to publication of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> as Linked Data vocabularies. We need discussion of practical initiatives to link between congruent vocabularies and provide effective web services and APIs so that applications can build upon them.</li>
<li><strong><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> and Document Retrieval</strong>. Documents or parts of documents are nowadays not only accessible via their metadata but their abstracts and in many cases the full texts are electronically available. Thus, these documents also can be found by search engines. Given this possibility of full text search the role of classification and annotation has to be redefined. Questions like the following ones arise: can traditional knowledge organization and document annotation improve full text retrieval? Are classification, categorisation, annotation, tagging, and full text retrieval complementary, or how can they be made complementary? What should be the focus of annotation, if full text retrieval is available?<br>
<br>Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the call for papers:</li>
<li><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>-based recommender systems. The suggestion of the right meaningful concepts is a mission critical phase for searchers in modern <abbr title="Digital Libraries">DL</abbr>.</li>
<li>Observatory for Knowledge Organization Systems – following the recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://knowescape.org/event/observatory-knowledge-organisation-systems/">Knowescape workshop</a>  with its main topics <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> provenance and versioning.</li>
<li>Meaningful Concept Display and Meaningful Visualization of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>.</li>
<li>Standards developments.</li>
<li>Evaluation of <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>-based systems – methods and practical experience.<br><br><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> applications are a regular and important part of <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> workshops. Example topics include:</li>
<li><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data, <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>, Semantic web.</li>
<li>Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>?</li>
<li>Users interaction with <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> in the online environment.</li>
<li><abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> and learning. What is required to use <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?</li> 
<li>Multilingual and Interdisciplinary <abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr> applications and tools.</li>
<li>Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Workshop structure</h3>
<p>
An open call for papers and demonstrations (submission deadline June 19<sup>th</sup>, notification July 19<sup>th</sup>) will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and professional societies with an interest in this field. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, demonstrations, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process and promote the workshop through the workshop website, their various contacts and discussion lists, including the <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> list and digital library lists. 
</p>
<h4>Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours</h4>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: Welcome, introduction, mutual presentations (hrs 0:30)</li>
<li>Session 2: Presentations on the main themes (hrs: 2:00)</li> 
<li>Session 3: Directed discussion emerging from the main session (hrs: 1:00)</li> 
<li>Session 4: Presentation and discussion of submitted papers on timely and related topics according to the CfP, including demonstrations (hrs: 2:00)</li>
<li>Session 5: Directed discussion emerging from the session 4 (hrs 1:00) </li>
<li>Session 6: Concluding discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0:30)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> practice, be available via the <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main <abbr title="Networked Knowledge Organization Systems and Services">NKOS</abbr> network website.
