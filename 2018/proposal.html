<h3>Extended abstract</h3>
<p>
We propose a full-day workshop of research projects and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended NKOS workshops at previous <abbr title="European Conference on Digital Libraries">ECDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries ">TPDL</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Conference on Digital Libraries">JCDL</abbr>, Dublin Core <abbr title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">DCMI</abbr> conferences (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">NKOS website</a> for details). We expect approximately 30 attendees at this workshop. The proposal is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website. 
</p>
<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), in the form of classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases, play a crucial role in digital information management and applications generally. Carrying semantics in a well-controlled and documented way, Knowledge Organization Systems serve a variety of important functions: tools for representation and indexing of information and documents, knowledge-based support to information searchers, semantic road maps to domains and disciplines, communication tool by providing conceptual framework, and conceptual basis for knowledge-based systems, e.g. automated classification systems.
</p>
<h3>Brief description of the workshop and its aims</h3>
<p>
The proposed joint NKOS workshop at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.tpdl.eu/tpdl2018/"><abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr>2018</a> / <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://dublincore.org/conference/2018/"><abbr title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">DCMI</abbr>2018</a> will explore the potential of KOS such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases, in the context of current developments and possibilities. These tools help to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the Semantic Web. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential cooperation.  
</p>
<p>
The workshop will also allow major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field, while facilitating the discussions of topical issues which require consensus or coordination, including standards efforts. Thus, for example,  previous workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of <abbr title="British Standards Institution">BSI</abbr> and <abbr title="International Organization for Standardization">ISO</abbr> KOS standards, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr> standard, the interface between traditional library and information science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, KOS linked data, social tagging and its relation to established vocabularies, KOS metadata and the different types of KOS. The <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> / <abbr title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">DCMI</abbr> venue affords participation by KOS researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as KOS design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of KOS in registries. 
</p>
<p>
In 2016 we published a special issue on Networked Knowledge Organization Systems in the International Journal on Digital Libraries (<abbr title="International Journal of Digital Libraries">IJDL</abbr>, see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://doi.org/10.1007/s00799-015-0167-x">Mayr et al. 2016</a>). This special issue evolved from the 13th NKOS workshop held at the joint Digital Libraries conference 2014 in London. We are preparing a further NKOS special issue in <abbr title="International Journal of Digital Libraries">IJDL</abbr> for 2018, building on NKOS workshops at <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> 2017 and Dublin Core 2017. We will discuss the potential for a further NKOS special issue at the proposed <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> / <abbr title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">DCMI</abbr> 2018 workshop.
</p>

<p>
The proposed workshop will have three themes as the main focus, together with topical presentations arising from the workshop call for presentations. <strong>A particular feature of this year’s workshop will be the combination of European and US perspectives</strong>; the co-location of <abbr title="Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries">TPDL</abbr> with <abbr title="Dublin Core Metadata Initiative">DCMI</abbr> facilitates the coming together of NKOS communities from the USA and Europe.
</p>
<h3>Workshop themes</h3>

<li><strong>Alignment/enrichment of metadata to existing KOS Linked Open Data.</strong> Recent years have seen an increasing trend to publication of KOS as Linked Data vocabularies. We need discussion of relevant issues and examples of KOS-driven metadata enrichment for a variety of data collection providers, including libraries, archives, museums, publishers, government agencies, international organizations, and also commercial organizations.</li>
<li><strong>KOS alignment/interoperability.</strong> KOS alignment or terminology mapping has been playing a vital role in NKOS for many years. We will continue this theme with discussion of specific case studies.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic KOS-based subject indexing / classification /entity-extracting</strong> is a classic KOS topic which has seen renewed interest regarding evaluation methodologies.
<br><br>Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the CfP:</li>


<li>KOS-based recommender systems. The suggestion of the right meaningful concepts is a mission critical phase for searchers in modern <abbr title="Digital Libraries">DL</abbr>.</li> 
<li>Observatory for Knowledge Organization Systems – following recent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://knowescape.org/event/observatory-knowledge-organisation-systems/">Knowescape workshop</a> with its main topics of KOS provenance and versioning.</li>
<li>Meaningful concept display and meaningful visualization of KOS.</li>
<li>Standards developments.</li>
<li>Evaluation of KOS-based systems – methods and practical experience.
<br><br>KOS applications are a regular and important part of NKOS workshops. Example topics include:
</li>
 
<li>KOS in e-Research metadata contexts - intersection between research data and KOS</li>
<li>Social tagging. What is the role of social tagging and informal knowledge structures versus established KOS? (How) can tagging be guided and informed by KOS?</li> 
<li>Users interaction with KOS in the online environment.</li> 
<li>KOS and learning. What is required to use KOS effectively to convey meaning, to assist users to express their information needs to assist in sense making and learning?</li> 
<li>Multilingual and interdisciplinary KOS applications and tools.</li> 
<li>Specific domains, such as environmental, medical, new application contexts, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Workshop structure</h3>
<p>
An open call for papers and demonstrations (submission deadline June 12<sup>th</sup>, notification July 10<sup>th</sup>) will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and professional societies with an interest in this field. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, demonstrations, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process and promote the workshop through the workshop website, their various contacts and discussion lists, including the NKOS list and digital library lists. 
</p>
<h4>Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours</h4>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: Welcome, introduction, mutual presentations (hrs 0:30)</li>
<li>Session 2: Presentations on the main themes (hrs: 2:00)</li> 
<li>Session 3: Directed discussion emerging from the main session (hrs: 1:00)</li> 
<li>Session 4: Presentation and discussion of submitted papers on timely and related topics according to the CfP, including demonstrations (hrs: 2:00)</li>
<li>Session 5: Directed discussion emerging from the session 4 (hrs 1:00) </li>
<li>Session 6: Concluding discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0:30)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. This would include abstracts of presentations, information on participants, list of resources, projects and plans for the workshop before the conference. 
</p>

<p>
Workshop proceedings will be deposited online in the CEUR workshop proceedings publication service (ISSN 1613-0073) - This way the proceedings will be permanently available and citable (digital persistent identifiers and long term preservation). After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website. There will also be an option for presenters to produce a short paper for publication in CEUR Proceedings of the workshop (see References).
