<p><strong>Duration: 1 day. Expected number of participants: 30</strong></p> 

<h3>Extended abstract</h3> 
<p>
We propose a full-day workshop of research projects and development related to next-generation Networked Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (NKOS) in digital libraries. This proposal builds on the well-attended NKOS workshops at previous ECDL, TPDL, JCDL, Dublin Core DCMI conferences (see <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://nkos.slis.kent.edu/">NKOS website</a>  for details). We expect approximately 30 attendees at this workshop. The proposal is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website and see references to previous workshops below with links to presentations, proceedings and special journal issues. We will discuss the potential for a further NKOS special issue at the proposed workshop.
</p>
<p>
Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), in the form of classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases, play a crucial role in digital information management and applications generally. Carrying semantics in a well-controlled and documented way, Knowledge Organisation Systems serve a variety of important functions: tools for representation and indexing of information and documents, knowledge-based support to information searchers, semantic road maps to domains and disciplines, communication tools by providing a conceptual framework, and a conceptual basis for knowledge-based systems, e.g. automated classification systems.
</p>

<h3>Brief description of the workshop and its aims</h3>
<p>
The proposed NKOS workshop at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.tpdl.eu/tpdl2019/">TPDL 2019</a> will explore the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS), such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases, in the context of current developments and possibilities. These tools help to model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, and the Semantic Web. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential cooperation.
</p>
<p> 
The workshop will also allow major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field, while facilitating the discussions of topical issues which require consensus or coordination, including standards efforts. Thus, for example, previous workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of BSI and ISO KOS standards, the W3C SKOS standard, the interface between traditional library and information science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, KOS linked data, social tagging and its relation to established vocabularies, KOS metadata and the different types of KOS. The TPDL venue affords participation by KOS researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as KOS design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of KOS in registries.
</p>
<p>
The proposed workshop will have two themes as the main focus, together with topical presentations arising from the workshop call for presentations. 
</p>

<h3>Workshop themes</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>KOS mappings</strong>. Mappings (or alignment) between KOS is attracting increasing attention with the expression of KOS as Linked Data and multilingual archives.</li>
<li><strong>Users interaction</strong> with KOS in retrieval including the role of KOS in online search systems<br><br>
Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the CfP: </li>
<li>Automatic KOS-based subject indexing / classification /entity-extraction.</li>
<li>KOS-based recommender systems.</li> 
<li>Meaningful concept display and meaningful visualization of KOS.</li>
<li>Standards developments.</li>
<li>Evaluation of KOS-based systems – methods and practical experience.</li>
<li>KOS in e-Research metadata contexts.</li> 
<li>KOS and (e)learning.</li> 
<li>Use of KOS in Artificial Intelligence applications - methods and practical experience.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Workshop structure</h3>
<p>
An open call for papers and demonstrations (submission deadline June 17, notification July 22) will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and professional societies with an interest in this field. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, demonstrations, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process and promote the workshop through the workshop website, their various contacts and discussion lists, including the NKOS list and digital library lists. 
</p>

<h4>Indicative agenda structure, covering approximately 8 hours</h4>
<ul>
<li>Session 1: Welcome, introduction, mutual presentations (hrs 0:30)</li>
<li>Session 2: Presentations on the main themes (hrs: 2)</li> 
<li>Session 3: Directed discussion emerging from the main session (hrs: 1)</li> 
<li>Session 4: Presentation and discussion of submitted papers on timely and related topics According to the CfP, including demonstrations (hrs: 2)</li> 
<li>Session 5: Directed discussion emerging from the session 4 (hrs 1)</li> 
<li>Session 6: Concluding discussion, including options for co-operation (hrs 0.30)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Supporting material for the workshop would, following standard NKOS practice, be available via the NKOS website. After the workshop, copies of presentations will be made available on the website and via the main NKOS network website. There will also be an option for presenters to produce a paper for publication in CEUR Workshop Proceedings of the workshop (see NKOS archive).

She is the author of six books and over 200 articles, including her newest publication, The Taxobook, a three-volume collection on the history and implementation of taxonomies.  She holds two U.S. patents encompassing 21 patent claims. Her research areas include furthering the productivity of content creation and the governance layer for information access through automated indexing, thesaurus development, taxonomy creation, natural language processing, machine translations, and machine aided indexing. She is a popular speaker on topics involving information organization, semantic enrichment, and taxonomy and thesaurus creation.  Her latest area is inverting the cataloging process in libraries to a metadata driven methodology where MARC and OPAC are exports of a richer semantic coverage to the materials held, leading to better discovery and retrieval.
