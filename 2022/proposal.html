<h3>Short description</h3>

<p>
	The workshop will explore the potential of Knowledge Organization Systems (<abbr title="Knowledge Organization Systems">KOS</abbr>), such as classification systems, taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, and lexical databases, in the context of current developments and possibilities, including health related aspects. These tools help model the underlying semantic structure of a domain for purposes of information retrieval, knowledge discovery, language engineering, etc. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential cooperation.
</p>

<h3>Workshop objectives and outcomes</h3>

<p>
	The workshop aims to explore the potential of KOS in the context of current developments and possibilities, including health related aspects. The workshop provides an opportunity to discuss projects, research and development activities, evaluation approaches, lessons learned, and research findings. The workshop will allow major projects to report results, newcomers to interact with established people in the field, while facilitating the discussions of topical issues which require consensus or coordination, including standards efforts. A further objective is to systematically engage in discussions in common areas of interest with selected related communities and to investigate potential cooperation.
</p>

<p>
	Previous NKOS workshops have seen focused discussion on early drafts of BSI and ISO KOS standards, the W3C SKOS standard, the interface between traditional library and information science vocabularies and Semantic Web efforts, KOS linked data, social tagging and its relation to established vocabularies, automated approaches, KOS metadata and the different types of KOS. The JCDL venue affords participation by KOS researchers and developers from different perspectives (reflecting the different conference threads), such as KOS design and construction, API and service developers, user oriented issues, management of KOS in registries and semi-automated methodologies.
</p>

<p>
	Presentations will be made available on the workshop website. The potential for a further NKOS special issue will be discussed at the workshop. There have been NKOS special issues of Knowledge Organisation in 2021, Journal of Data and Information Science in 2020, the International Journal on Digital Libraries in 2016, 2018; New Review of Hypermedia and Multimedia in 2006; Journal of Digital Information in 2004, 2001. Recently an archive of the European NKOS workshops and the content has been created at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nkos-eu.github.io/">https://nkos-eu.github.io/</a>. The NKOS website at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nkos.dublincore.org/">https://nkos.dublincore.org/</a> has background and information on all workshops and special issues
</p>

<h3>Workshop Outline</h3>

<p>
	The proposed workshop will have two themes as the main focus, together with topical presentations arising from the workshop call for presentations.
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Health-related KOS</strong> issues and contributions particularly concerning the current pandemic</li>
	<li><strong>Designing for Cultural Hospitality</strong> and <strong>Indigenous Knowledge</strong> in KOS</li>

<br><p>Further timely presentations/demonstrations will be selected from the following topics in the CfP:</p>

	<li>KOS mappings. Mappings (or alignment) between KOS</li>
	<li>Users interaction with KOS in retrieval including semantic search</li>
	<li>Standards developments.</li>
	<li>Evaluation of KOS-based systems - methods and practical experience.</li>
	<li>KOS support of natural language processing, esp. information extraction, enrichment</li>
	<li>Use of KOS in Artificial Intelligence applications - methods and practical experience.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Workshop structure</h3>

<p>
	We propose a full-day workshop building on the well-attended NKOS workshops at previous JCDL, ECDL, TPDL, DCMI conferences. The workshop is in collaboration with ISKO Italy and is supported by the international NKOS network, its website and discussion list. Presentations are made available on the workshop website and see references to previous workshops below with links to presentations, proceedings and special journal issues. We will discuss the potential for a further NKOS journal special issue at the workshop and/or Springer CCIS Proceedings.
</p>

<p>
	An open call for papers and demonstrations (submission deadline April 12th, notification April 26th) will be combined with selected invitations from major projects and professional societies with an interest in this field. The workshop is planned to consist of an introduction, technical presentations, demonstrations, and a concluding directed discussion. The program committee will assist the review process as first-tier reviewers. The organisers will coordinate the process and promote the workshop through the workshop website, their various contacts and discussion lists, including the NKOS list.
</p>
