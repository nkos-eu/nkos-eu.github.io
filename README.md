## Networked Knowledge Organization Systems ![NKOS](/favicon.png)

This repository contains web pages, abstracts and presentations associated with the [NKOS series of European workshops](https://nkos-eu.github.io/).

> NKOS is devoted to the discussion of the functional and data model for enabling knowledge organization systems/services (KOS), 
> such as classification systems, thesauri, gazetteers, and ontologies, as networked interactive information services to support 
> the description and retrieval of diverse information resources through the Internet. 

> Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (KOS) model the underlying semantic structure of a domain. Embodied as Web-based services, 
> they can facilitate resource discovery and retrieval. They act as semantic road maps and make possible a common orientation by 
> indexers and future users (whether human or machine). -- Douglas Tudhope, Traugott Koch
